house banking and currency committeehas been given jurisdiction over titles vi and vii of the socalledthe latter committee scheduled gold bill hearings march  andimmediately afterward is expected to begin executive session markrapid enactment is anticipatedorganized labors position to be presented the last day of hearings is that dollar devaluation in itself does not provide adequateremedies and that the stronger measures embodied in the hartkeburkebill are neededtitle vi of that measure would empower the president to prohibitany transactions involving direct or indirect transferof capital to

process licensing others to manufacture the patented product or usingthe patented process outside united states territorywhen in the presidents judgment such prohibitionwill contribute to increased employment in the unitedstates title vii would require onerous reporting provisions includingcomplete statistics on working conditions in multinational companies outside the united states as well as

committeetomanufacturing chemists associationnovember  by henry w rahn chairmanit is three years since the eac committee last reported directly to this boardin the interim several significant developments have occurred affecting the areawherein the committee functions  namely the industrialacademic interface theseinclude first  employment opportunities for new technical graduates in the chemicalindustry shrank to low levels seeond  a wave of technical staff reductions by jobtermination ran through the industry in  and  and third  societys attitudetoward our industry underwent deterioration to where we now labor under the burden ofa negative public image it is most appropriate therefore and i welcome this opportunity to review for you the committees objectives plans and activities structuredto meet our assignment and responsibility to the mca under conditions so changed fromthe pastcommittee evolutionthe committee was first established in the mid s when as you will recall therewas a shortage of graduate chemists the initial objective was to encourage studentsi pursue a career in chemistry so as to assure an adequate supply of chemists for thexpanding needs of our industryuntil the mid s the committee continued to follow a program of recruiting studentsinto chemistry but then some red flags went up when careful reviews of technicalgraduate supplydemand studies lad several of our members to predict that the high postworld war ii birth rates would result in an oversupply of chemists in the early s therough coincidence of this graduate oversupply timing with the economic downturn of thechemical industry beginning in  and the layoffs of employed chemists and chemicalengineers which ensued accelerated the rate at which the oversupply of unemployedch micallytrained persons was growing as of earlier this year  of all chemists years of age or less were unemployed faced with these unsettling aspects in the jobmarket the committee decided to modify its objectives instead of stressing recruitmentwe began to focus on the quality and type of training suitable for chemists going intoindustrycma future technical manpower supplydemand relationshipin looking ahead we are confronted with a highly confused picture concerning thefuture demandsupply relationship for new graduate scientific and engineering manpower major longrange studies reaching into the s by such prestigious groupsas the national science foundation scientific manpower commission engineeringmanpower commission of the joint engineers council and the u s department oflabor reach varying forecasts ranging from prediction of years of oversupply to direwarnings of impending shortagesperhaps this is to be expected as the nation grapples with the problem of changingpriorities and shifting activities and in view of this it would appear that the use ofhistorical trend data for predicting technical manpower supplies ten years from now forcessome degree of uncertainty into the forecasts but the weight of the evidence seems tolie on the side of an impending shortage the shortrange forecasts on the other handas mode by similarly competent groups are considered to be much more reliable wecan discuss these figures with more confidence in general such studies predict wewill experience a sharp downward trend in bs ms and phd degrees awarded inchemistry and all engineering during the next four yearsif this downward trend continues there is reason to believe that a shortage of someproportions could develop in the supply of scientific and engineering graduates asresponsible members of the chemical industry i believe there is cause for us to be concerned over both the short and long range situation i will not burden you with acomplete statistical analysis that supports this conclusion but here are some significantdetailsfirst undergraduate enrollments for majors in chemistry have historically increasedmodestly each year in  however the number of ft s degrees awarded inchemistry declined for the first time in  years we conclude that a high drop outrate between entry and graduation for chemistry majors has taken placesecond the number of first year graduate students in phd chemistry programs hasdeclined  since  statistics for each year indicate an increased number ofstudents who earn a degree in chemistry only as a stepping stone to careers in otherfieldsthird undergraduate enrollments and earned degrees in engineering are decliningsignificantly from the total engineering bachelor supply of  graduating in the output in  is expected to fall to against this background of rapidlydeclining interest in scientific and engineeringdegrees there are some that claim that even larger decreases in the employed technicalworicforce may be necessary as an adjustment to changing r  d priorities if this becomes nee ssary i susp ct w will find the students moving ever farther away from thechemical industry a developm nt we would all like to avoid if possiblecma the chemical industry as you well know is an industry of great complexityrequiring many high level intellects to effectively develop manage and operatethe enterprise our future ability to attract such individuals in the numbers requiredwill depend largely on the prestige of the occupation working conditions and personalopportunities for growthin attempting to assess future requirements for new graduate chemists and chemicalengineers we make the prediction this number will remain a reasonably stable percentagef the total industrial workforce at the risk of oversimplification we have reached thisconclusion by assuming two important opposing demand trends will tend to balance eachother the downward trend involved rd during the past  years ift activitiesaccounted for a large fraction of total technical employment with this fraction tendingto become smaller as rd is deemphasized one can logically reason future needs forchemists and chemical engineers in this area will diminish on the other hand anupward trend involving newlyemerging problem areas such as environmental controland the impending energy crisis which heretofore have not been factors of any significance as users or chemically trained personnel could possibly impose heavy future demands against supply offsetting losses in the id sector of the chemical industry consequently we believe continued reductions in chemistry and engineering majors andearned degrees will likely leadto shortages of technical graduate manpower resourcesin view of the uncertainty surrounding future needs it is tempting to adopt a wait andsee attitude the committee counsels against this because to do so will underminethe attractiveness of chemistry and the chemical industry as a oareer choice for students further it will likely intensify the negative image many students and young facultyspecially in nonscience areas have for the chemical and other technicallyorientedindustry and above all we must bear in mind that the manpower problems we anticipatein four or eight years are in fact todays problems because the new chemists and engineers we will hire then are in the educational pipeline nowrestoration of confidence in industryif you agree with me that there has indeed been a loss of confidence by the student bodyin our industry the question then arises as to what steps we can take to restore it weof the committee feel this is a serious matter that should be promptly dealt with in somepositive way in conjunction with the public relations committee we are organizing aneffort to define a program for your consideration meanwhile i urge you to give withus serious consideration to this matter so that the mca and the industry can have animportant continuing influence on the educational system and on national manpowerplanning commissionsobjectives  plans  activities  accomplishmentsagainst the foregoing background i would now like to report on our current programsand activities in  the board approved a realignment of our objectives and functionaccording t the greatly altered mployment and economic eonditi ns confr nting membercompanies our objective became to promote through the educational systempublic understanding of the chemical industry to assist in career guidance to enhancethe quality of education in chemistry chemical engineering and interdisciplinaryfields related to chemistry to promote the teaching of chemistry and related sciencesin a broad intellectual cultural and social context at all levels of education wethus reaffirmed our primary mission to collaborate with educators and educationalsystems our activities were then reorganized and channeled into three categoriesall judged to be of importance in attaining our objectives these areqiicareer guidancechemical educationpublic understanding of the chemical industryeach area of concern is assigned to a separate mibcommittee concerning their workthe following is of interestcareer guidance subcommitteethis group finds itself in the paradoxical situation of motivating students toward chemistryat a time when trained scientists are unemployed this contrasts with a past period ofmore than two decades when expansion and growth of the industry assured multiple jobopportunities for each new chemist employment prospects prevailing at the time astudent made a career decision remained essentially unchanged  or  or  years laterwhen he entered the job market specialization was the name of the game careerobjectives for specific positions could be described succinctly in terms of course requirements and skills career guidance was then a very legitimate facet of recruitment inadvance when there are concrete job openings only recently have some associationsprofessional societies and companies abandoned this activity in view of changed conditionssome few years ago the career guidance subcommittee began to redirect its efforts togive greater emphasis to the variety of tasks performed in the chemical industry thereis a continuing need for people with a chemical background but as you know the application of their education and training might not conform to the traditional andacademic image of the chemist or chemical engineer the subcommittee encouragesthose with particular ability and interest in chemistry to a career in r  d howeverfor most in industry the translation of theoretical information into practical realitiessuch as administration marketing personnel liaison with government and public relations defines where the action is consequently an education should be directedto the broad spectrum of job opportunities and develop the individual interests andskills of the studentseveral experimental career booklets were developed to present the new approach tomore than  educators students and administrators who requested copies a newedition of the booklet will be distributed early next year incorporating many helpfulsuggesti ns received from teachers and studentscma t is courageous to phase out old and luccessful programs and innovate when ourcareer guidance efforts rode the crest of the wave of acceptance among educatorsand students during the  fiscal year for example we filled requestsfor more than  career booklets and  flyers it is preferable as youwill agree to be ahead of change rather than unwitting victims of itthis subcommittee also assists and encourages the increased number of those whoelect chemistry as a cultural background or as a foundation for careers in fieldssuch as medicine law and marketing which have competing claims on technicallytrained men and womenchemical education subcommitteethis group spearheads efforts to influence chemical education as a measure of oursuccess and acceptance among academic chemists during the past two years membersf our committee have been participants by invitation at three major chemical educationconferences and at tke white house conference on youth in the past year wecollaborated by invitation with the national science foundation in the preliminaryplanning and implementation of a new educational program in which

committee formed at the februaryexecutivecommittee meeting was to study how to make mca more effective withparticular reference to but not limited to washington and governmentrelations a preliminary report was made to the executive committeeand to the board in march and several suggestions were approvedthe committee feels that this report represents only a first steptowards strengthening mca and that the effectiveness of mca ought to bereviewed annually by the executive committee and the boarddiscussions with a cross section of board members mca staffand member company personnel serving on mca committees and on thewashington scene pointed to a central need and opportunity to improvecommunications the committee believes mcas communications can beimproved in a number of areas by eliminating layering sharpening objectives focusing efforts on key groups and coordinating the activities ofvarious parts of the associationtherefore the following steps are recommended to strengthenmcas communications the agenda for board meetings should be revamped to includeadditional reports from chairmen of technical and functional committeesa regular review of legislative activity by the director of government relations and periodic reports from other mca staff members as set forthin the recommended agenda attached as exhibit a the four board liaisoncommittees should be eliminated also the scene should be set in a waycma that will permit pointed questioning regarding and critical discussion ofmca affairs at least two more board meetings should be held each year inwashington to focus attention on governmental matters and to facilitate contacts with government personnel a recommended schedule of board meetings for  is attached as exhibit b closer communication between executive contacts especiallythoae who are mca board members and personnel from their companieswho serve on technical and functional committees is very much in order andneeds to be encouraged the executive committee in conformity with suggested changesin board procedures and in addition to its present activities should make anannual review of mca a effectiveness including the work of as well as theneed for the various committees any action which would have a significantfinancial impact should be decided upon prior to january when developmentof the budget begins the executive committee should also formulate a listof the most critical issues facing the industry and indicate those issues forwhich mca positions should be developeda letter should be sent from the chairman of the board to allexecutive contacts following the june  greenbrier meeting outlining thenewly adopted approaches and procedures for the  mca year andsoliciting their active interest and participationboard meetingsthe agenda for board meetings will be prepared by the presidentfollowing consultation as appropriate with the chairman of the board andsent to the directors well in advance of meetings routine business of theassociation should be dealt with briefly on the assumption that directors hadread the material which was supplied prior to the meetingof considerable importance is the arrangement of the agenda in sucha way that there can be appropriate questioning and discussion regardingimportant mca matters at some past meetings several board membershave felt the opportunity for meaningful discussion was limited or precludedproviding for frank deliberation will permit a fuller contribution from theboard and will recognize the considerable investment of time by board members however this increased participation by the board in mca affairsshould not be permitted to diminish the role and the effectiveness of the executive committeethe president would present first an overview of mcas situationproviding perspective and priorities with regard to important issues opportunities and problemscma this would befollowed by a brief legislative report from thedirector of government relations plus reports from any other membersof the mca staff who have an important matter to bring to the boardsattentionnext three or four chairmen of technical or functional committees would report on substantive matters pending in those committeesroutine organizational matters and accomplishments should be excludedthe four board liaison committees have helped a great deal but thereis a prevailing opinion that the growing complexity and importance of theissues the industry is facing require the active and direct involvement ofthe board and that to shorten communications lines the liaison committees should be dissolvedonethird of the  mca committees currently have chairmenfrom companies which are not represented on the board when one ofthese chairmen reports to the board the executive contact from his company should be invited to attend the meetingthe above format would normally take two hours and this timeshould be regularly allotted in planning schedulestwo more washington board meetings january and octoberwould improve communications considerably such meetings would alsohelp focus board attention on the critical matters in the governmentalarea and provide an opportunity the night before the board meeting formembers to have dinner with government people the successful chemicalforum luncheons would be tied in the next day good staff work and coordinated efforts are called for here to see that mca interests are effectivelyconveyed to the governmentwith regard to regional board meetings the program committee ought to devote special attention to increasing their value to those attending by providing a program which contributes insight into regionalindustry interests especially governmental activitiesgovernment relations activitycommunications among the government relations staff othermca staff members the technical and functional committees and washington representatives of member companies should be improved
