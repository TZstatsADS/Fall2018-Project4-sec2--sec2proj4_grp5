COMMITTEE EDLUTIDN The Cofmstte was flist establishing 1n the mm 50': when. as you Will recall, thore was a stort.ge of graduate ctemistos. The initial objective was to encourage studento 1 putise a areor 1n ctctemistry, so as to assre an adequate sppby of ctemistos for the pandlng had: of our 1industry. Untll the m d 50's, the Cofmsettor continued to follow a prproegram of reducing studento 1nto ctarms ry. But then sofe red flags went up, when careful review of tecannual graduate spresent studles lad seporal of our memboreis to proeduct that the hiof tost Wold War I birth rates would reslt 1n an opeisppby of ctemistos 1n the eeaby 70's. The rouof gold dance of this graduate opeisppby timing, mm the econofic downturn of the ctemscal 1nustry beginnlng 1n 1959, and the layoffs of employed ctemistos and ctemscal englbeeis w 1Ch ensed, accelorator the rate at whlct the opeisppby of ubemployed ct recall rabed peisons was growing. As of eallor this year, 25% of all ctemistos 25 yeais of an; or less wore ubemployed. Faced mm these settle aspecto 1n the job mareet. the Cofmsettor declded to mode 1:5 objectives. Instead of strong recttment, we began to focts on the quall and type of training sltable for ctemistos going 1nto 1industry.
