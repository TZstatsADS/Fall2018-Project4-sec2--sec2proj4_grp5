After key House commlttee members were alerted to organlzed Labor's
strategy, assurances were obtalned that the gold leglslatlon would
be kept free of encumberlng amendments and that the Hartke43urke
measures would be ruled nonigemane.
on March 1, the Senate approved the gold leglslatlon requlred by
the Presldent to unplement negotlated 1nternatlonal monetary agree*

November 20, 1972
By Henry w. Rahn, Chalrman
1: 15 three years Since the EAC Commlttee last reported dlrectly m thls Board.
In the 1nte1m, several Significant developments have occurred affectlng the area
whereln the Commlttee functlons 7 namely, the 1ndustrlaliacadem1c 1nterface. These
1nclude: £15: 7 employment opportunltles for new technlcal graduates 1n the chemlcal
1ndustry shank to low levels; seeond 7 a wave of technlcal staff reductlons by job
temlnatlon ran through the 1ndustry 1n 197D and 1971; and thlrd 7 soclety's attltude
toward our ndustry underwent deterloratlon m where we now labor under the burden of
a negatlve ubllc image. 1: 15 most approprlate, therefore, and I welcome thls opi
portunlty tn revlew for you the Commlttee's objectlves, plans and actlvltles, structured
to meet our asslgnment and responslblllty m the MCA under condltlons so changed from
the past.
COMMITTEE EDLUTIDN
The Commltte was flrst establlshed 1n the mm 50': when. as you Will recall, there
was a short.ge of graduate chemlsts. The initial objectlve was to encourage students
1 pursue a areer 1n chemlstry, so as to assure an adequate supply of chemlsts for the
xpandlng had: of our 1ndustry.
Untll the m d 50's, the Commlttee contlnued to follow a program of recrultlng students
1nto charms ry. But then some red flags went up, when careful revlews of technlcal
graduate suplyidemand studles lad several of our members to predlct that the high post
World War I blrth rates would result 1n an oversupply of chemlsts 1n the early 70's. The
rough colnc dance of thls graduate oversupply timing, mm the economlc downturn of the
chemlcal 1nustry beglnnlng 1n 1959, and the layoffs of employed chemlsts and chemlcal
englneers w 1Ch ensued, accelerated the rate at whlch the oversupply of unemployed
ch mlcallyi ralned persons was growlng. As of earller thls year, 25% of all chemlsts 25
years of an; or less were unemployed. Faced mm these unsettllng aspects 1n the job
market. the Commlttee declded to modlfy 1:5 objectlves. Instead of stresslng recrultment,
we began to focus on the quallty and type of training sultable for chemlsts golng 1nto
1ndustry.

wrung TECH ICAL mmowm SWPLY’DEMAND RELATIONSHIP
In looklng -head, we are confronted mm a mghly confused picture concernlng the
future dema disupply relatlonshlp for new graduate sclentlflc and englneerlng man*
power. Majo longirange studles reachlng 1nto the 1980's by such prestlglous groups
as the Natl-nal Sclence Foundatlbn. Sclentlflc Manpower Commlsslon, Englneerlng
Manpower Co ‘ lsslon of the Joint Englneers Councll and the v. 5. Department of
Labor reach Varylng forecasts, ranglng from predlctlon of years of oversupply m dlre
Harnlngs of impending shortages.
Perhaps mu 1: to be expected as the natlon grapples mm the problem of changlng
priorities -nd shlftlng actlvltles. And 1n Vlew of thls, 1: would appear that the use of
hlstorlcal rend data for predlctlng technlcal manpower supplies ten years from now forces
some degree of uncertalnty 1nto the forecasts. But the welght of the evldence seems to
he on the 1de of an impending shortage. The shortirange forecasts, on the other hand,
as mode by 1mllarly competent groups, are consldered m be much more rellable. We
can dlscus these flgures Hlth more confldence. In general, such studles predlct He
Will exper -nce a sharp downward trend 1n 13.5., 24.5. and 1mm. degrees awarded 1n
chemlstry . d all englneerlng durlng the next four years.
If thls do nward trend contlnueS, there 1: reason to belleve that a shortage of some
proportlon could develop 1n the supply of sclentlflc and englneerlng graduates. A5
responslbl- members of the chemlcal 1ndustry, I belleve there 15 cause for us to be
7 concerns over both the short and long range Situation. I Will not burden you mm a
complete s-atlstlcal analysls that supports thls concluslon, but here are some Significant
detalls.
First, und-rgraduate enrollments for majors 1n chemlstry have hlstorlcally 1ncreased
modestly e.gh year. In 1970, however, the number of ft” 5. degrees awarded 1n
chemlstry ecllned for the flrst time 1n 20 years. We conclude that a hlgh "drop out"
rate betwe-n entry and graduatlon for chemlstry majors has taken place.
Second, th- number of flrst year graduate students 1n 1mm. chemlstry programs has
decllned 2-a Since 1955. Statlstlcs for each year indicate an 1ncreased number of
students w o earn a degree 1n chemlstry only as a "stepplng stone" to careers 1n other
flelds.
Thlrd, undrgraduate enrollments and earned degrees 1n englneerlng are decllnlng
Slgnlflcanly. From the total englneerlng bachelor supply of 43,000 graduatlng 1n
1971, the mutput 1n 1975 1: expected to fall to 31,000.
Agalnst th 5 background of rapldlyidecllnlng 1nterest 1n sclentlflc and englneerlng
degrees. tare are some that clalm that even larger decreases 1n the employed technlcal
worlcforce may be necessary, as an adjustment to changlng R L n prlorltles. If thls ha?
comes nee sary, I susp at w Hill 61nd the students movlng ever farther away from the
chemlcal 1dustry, a developm nt we would all llke to avold 15 posslble.
CMA 035214
The chemlc.l 1ndustry, as you well know, 15 an 1ndustry of great complexlty,
requlrlng any high level 1ntellects to effectlvely develop, manage and operate
the entezp 15a. Our future ability to attract such 1nd1v1duals 1n the numbers requlred
Hill depen largely on the prestlge of the occupatlon, worklng condltlons and personal
opportunlt as for growth.
In attempt mg to assess future requlrements for new graduate chemlsts and chemlcal
englneers, we make the predlctlon thls number will remaln a reasonably stable percentage
5 the tots 1ndustrlal workforce. At the rlsk of overslmpllflcatlon, we have reached thls
concluslon by assumlng two 1mportant opposlng demand trends will tend to balance each
other. The downward trend 1nvolved R/D. Durlng the past 25 years, 1A5: actlvltles
accounted or a large fractlon of total technlcal employment. mm thls fractlon tendlng
to become mailer, as R/D 15 daiemphaslzed, one can loglcally reason future needs for
chemlsts a d chemlcal englneers 1n thls area will dlmlnlsh. on the other hand, an
upward tre d 1nvolv1ng newlyiemerglng problem areas, such as envlronmental control
and the 1mend1ng energy crlsls, whlch heretofore have not been factors of any Slgmsk
canes as uers or chemlcally tralned personnel, could posslbly impose heavy future dE*
mands algal st supply, offsettlng losses 1n the m: sector of the chemlcal 1ndustry. Coni
sequently, we belleve contlnued reductlons 1n chemlstry and englneerlng majors and
earned degees Hill llkely leadto shortages of technlcal graduate manpower resources.
In Vlew of the uncertalnty surroundlng future needs, 1: 15 temptlng to adopt 3 "Walt and
see" attlt de. The Commlttee counsels agalnst thls, because to do so will undemme
the attrac 1Veness of chemlstry and the chemlcal 1ndustry as a career cholce for students.
. Further. 1: Hill llkely 1ntenslfy the negatlve lmage many students and young faculty,
speclally n nonisclence areas, have for the chemlcal and other technlcallyiorlented
1ndustry. n d above all, we must bear 1n mlnd that the manpower problems we antlelpate
1n four 0 elght years are, 1n fact, today's problems because the new chemlsts and englneers
' He Will Ilre then are 1n the educatlonal pipeline now.
RESTORATII 0F coupmmm m muusmy
If you an; as mm me that there has 1ndeed been a loss of confldence by the student body
1n our 1nustry, the questlon then arlses as to what steps we can take to restore 1:. We
of the Co ‘1ttee feel thls 15 a serlous matter that should be promptly dealt Hlth 1n some
posltlve ay. In conjunctlon mm the Publlc Relatlons Commlttee, we are organlzlng an
effort to deflne a program for your conslderatlon. Meanwhlle, I urge you to give, mm
us, serlo s conslderatlon to thls matter so that the MCA and the 1ndustry can have an
1mportant contlnulng 1nfluence on the educatlonal system and on natlonal manpower
plannlng .ommssmns.
OBJECTIVE 7 PLANS 7 ACTIVITIES 7 Accommsamms
Agalnst t e foregolng background, I would now llke to report on our current programs
and actlv tles. In 1971, the Board approved a reallgnment of our objectlves and functlon
accordlng t the greatly altered mployment and economlc eondltl n5 confr ntlng member
companles Our objectlve became: "To promote through the educatlonal system
publlc unerstandlng of the chemlcal 1ndustry; to 35515: 1n career guldance; to enhance
the quall-y of educatlon 1n chemlstry, chemlcal englneerlng and 1nterd15c1pllnary
flelds re ated m chemlstry; to promote the teachlng of chemlstry and related sclences
1n 3 broa- 1ntellectual, cultural and soclal context at all levels of educatlon." We
thus reaflmed our prlmary mlsslon to collaborate Hlth educators and educatlonal
systems. ur actlvltles were then reorganlzed and channeled 1nto three categorles,
all judge to be of unportance 1n attalnlng our objectlves. These are:

CAREER cu DANCE sumommrm
Th1: grou 61nd: 1tself 1n the paradoxlcal Situation of motlvatlng students toward chemlstry
at a time when tralned sclentlsts are unemployed. Th1: contrasts mm a past perlod of
more than two decades when expanslon and growth of the 1ndustry assured multlple job
opportunl ms for each new chemlst. Employment prospects prevalllng at the time a
student m.de a career declslon remalned essentlally unchanged 4 or a or 10 years later
when he a tered the job market. Speclallzatlon was the "name of the game"; career
objectlve for speclflc posltlons could be descrlbed succlnctly 1n terms of course requlre*
ments and skllls. Career guldance was then a Very legltlmate facet of recrultment 1n
advance, hen there are concrete job openlngs. Only recently have some assoclatlons,
professlo 31 socletles and companles abandoned thls actlvlty 1n Vlew of changed condltlons.

for 1nf-Imatlon and nomlnatlon toms.
Influen e on Currlcula; For almost 10 years the Chemlcal Educatlon Subcommlttee
has pro oted the 1ncluslon of practlcal chemlstry from 1ndustry 1nto chemlstry courses
on the 1gh school and lower college levels. When we flrst made the suggestlon, our
message went unneeded among educators who 1ntenslfled the theoretlcal content of
thelr c emlstry courses. Recently, other assoclatlons, professlonal socletles, major
chemlca educatlon conferences and educators concur mm our proposal. We collaborate
mm ed Gators to ensure that the 1ndustrlal world of chemlstry 15 a necessary adjunct to

In 1957 the flrst tltle 1n 3 10 book. Mczvsponsored "Chemlstry 1n Actlon Serles" was

The t 1rd and newest subcommlttee of the Educatlon Actlvltles Commlttee promotes

Thelr efforts are dlrected primarily to the nonisclence student and faculty who harbor
a neg.t1ve attltude toward :echmcallymnented 1ndustry. Many of these apostles,

destr ctlve goals. Though some would "wrlte off" thls group as 1gnorant, our contact

they .re open and willing to learn and change thelr attltudes.

From:

FINAL upon
The objectlve of thls commlttee, formed at the FebruaryiExecutlve
Commlttee meetlng, was to study how to make MCA more effectlve, Hlth
partlcular reference to, but not llmlted to, Washlngton and government
relatlons. A prellmlnary report was made to the Executlve Commlttee
and m the Board 1n March. and several suggestlons were approved.
The commlttee feels that thls report represents only a flrst step
towards strengthenlng MCA and that the effectlveness of MCA ought to be
revlewed annually by the Executlve Commlttee and the Board.
Dlscusslons Hlth a cross sectlon of Board members, MCA staff,
and member company personnel servlng on MCA commlttees and on the
Washlngton scene polnted m a central need and opportunlty m unprove
communlcatlons. The commlttee belleves MCA'S communlcatlons can be
1mproved 1n 3 number of areas by ellmlnatlng layerlng, sharpenlng objerk
tlves, focuslng efforts on key groups, and coordlnatlng the actlvltles of
Varlous parts of the Assoclatlon.
Therefore. the followlng steps are recommended to strengthen
MCA'S communlcatlons:l
1. The agenda for Board meetlngs should be revamped to 1nclude
addltlonal reports from chalmen of technlcal and functlonal commlttees,
a regular revlew of leglslatlve actlvlty by the Dlrector of Government Raf
latlons. and periodic reports from other MCA staff members, as set forth
1n the recommended agenda attached as Exhibit A. The four Board Liaison
Commlttees should be ellmlnated. Also, the scene should be set 1n 3 way
CMA 035303
that Hill permlt polnted questlonlng regardlng, and crltlcal dlscusslon of,
MCA affalrs.
2. At least two more Board meetlngs should be held each year 1n
Washlngton to focus attentlon on governmental matters and to facllltate con*
tact: mm government personnel. A recommended schedule of Board meeti
lngs for 1973774 15 attached as Exhibit B.
3. Closer communlcatlon between Executlve Contacts, especlally
those who are MCA Board members, and personnel from thelr companles
who serve on technlcal and functlonal commlttees 15 Very much 1n order and
needs to be encouraged.
4. The Executlve CommlttEE, 1n confomlty mm suggested changes
1n Board procedures and 1n addltlon to 1:: present actlvltles, should make an
annual revlew of MCAl a effectlveness, 1nclud1ng the work of, as well as the
need for, the Varlous commlttees. Any actlon whlch would have a Significant
flnanclal unpact should be declded upon prior to January, when development
of the budget beglns. The Executlve Commlttee should also formulate a 115:
of the most crltlcal lssues faclng the 1ndustry and 1nd1cate those lssues for
whlch MCA posltlons should be developed.
A letter should be sent from the Chalrman of the Board to all
Executlve Contacts followlng the June 1973 Greenbrler meetlng outllnlng the
newly adopted approaches and procedures for the 1973774 MCA year, and
sollcltlng thelr actlve 1nterest and partlclpatlon.
Board Meetlngs
The agenda for Board meetlngs Will be prepared by the Presldent,
followlng consultatlon as approprlate mm the Chalman of the Board and
sent to the Dlrectors well 1n advance of meetlngs. Routlne busmess of the
Assoclatlon should be dealt mm brlefly on the assumptlon that Dlrectors had
read the materlal whlch was supplled prior to the meetlng.
DE conslderable unportance 15 the arrangement of the agenda 1n such
a way that there can be approprlate questlonlng and dlscusslon regardlng
1mportant MCA matters. At some past meetlngs, several Board members
have felt the opportunlty for meanlngful dlscusslon was llmlted or precluded.
Provldlng for frank dellberatlon will permit a fuller contrlbutlon from the
Board and Hill recognlze the conslderable 1nvestment of time by Board mem*
bers. However. thls 1ncreased partlclpatlon by the Board 1n MCA affalrs
should not be permltted to dlmlnlsh the role and the effectlveness of the Ex*
ecutlve Commlttee.
The Presldent would present flrst an overvlew of MCA'S Situation,
provldlng perspectlve and priorities Hlth regard to unportant lssues, opi
portunltles. and problems.
CMA 035304
Th1: would be'followed by a brlef leglslatlve report from the
Dlrector of Government Relatlons plus reports from any other members
of the MCA staff who have an unportant matter to brlng m the Board's
attentlon.
Next. three or four chalrmen of technlcal or functlonal com?
mlttees would report on substantlve matters pendlng 1n those commlttees.
Routlne organlzatlonal matters and accompllshments should be excluded.
The four Board Liaison Commlttees have helped a great deal, but there
15 a prevalllng opinion that the growlng complexlty and unportance of th
lssues the 1ndustry 15 faclng requlre the actlve and threat 1nvolvement of
the Board. and that to shorten communlcatlons llnes the liaison Comml
tees should be dlssolved.
Onsithlrd of the 24 MCA commlttees currently have chalrmen
from companles whlch are not represented on the Board. When one 0
these chalrmen reports to the Board, the Executlve Contact from 5 com?
pany should be 1nv1ted to attend the meetlng.
The above format would nomany take two hours, and thls tune
should be regularly allotted 1n plannlng schedules.
Two more Washlngton Board meetlngs (January and October)
would 1mprove communlcatlons conslderably. Such meetlngs uld also
help focus Board attentlon on the crltlcal matters 1n th governmental
area. and provlde an opportunlty the night before the B ard meetlng for
members to have dlnner mm government people. The su essful Chemlcal
Forum luncheon: would be tled 1n the next day. Good 366 work and cook
dlnated efforts are called for here to see that MCA 1nterests are effectlvely
conveyed to the government.
mm regard to reglonal Board meetlngs, the Frog Commlti
tee ought to devote speclal attentlon m 1ncrea mg thelr value to those at?
tendlng by provldlng a program whlch contrlbu s 1n51ght 1nto reglonal
1ndustry 1nterests, especlally governmental tlvltles.
Government Relatlons Actlvlty
Communlcatlons among the Government Relat n5 staff, other
MCA staff members, the technlcal and fun lonal commlttees, and Wash?
lngton representatlves of member compan as should be 1mproved through
more fomallzed procedures.
In the past, MCA has been stymled at 1mes by an inability to
reach unanlmous agreement 1n the Va lous commlttees on what posltlon to
take and by a cumbersome clearance procedure. In the future, commlti
tees should try to proceed promp y m a declslon and where unanlmlty 15

...1n hls State of the Unlon message, emphaslsed the Admlni
lstratlon's leglslatlve proposals whlch were 1ntroduced last
year and on whlch congresslonal actlon has not yet been comi
plated.
Speclflcally, the Presldent urged the Congress to
take early actlon on welfare resom, health servlces, revenue
sharlng, the envlronment, consumer protectlon and transports?
tlon.
In addltlon m stresslng the need for actlon on proposed eni
Vlronmental leglslatlon, the Presldent stated he would soon be
sendlng m the Congress a message on the envlronment that would
present "further admlnlstratlve and leglslatlve initiatives."
The Presldent also 1nd1cated that he would soon propose new leglsJ
latlon concernlng:
A new technology program, wlth federal
1ncrease prlvate research, and
1ncent1ves m
Federally supported research on a range of projects
deslgned "m unprove our everyday llves."
Another area 1nvolv1ng new leglslatlve proposals concerns edui
catlon.
The Presldent stated he would recommend later 1n the
year a new way of flnanclng publlc schools to supplant rellance
on local property taxes.
mule no detalls were glven, 1: 15 under?
stood the Admlnlstratlon has been studylng the concept of a Valueadded tax as a means of raising revenue to pay for local schools.
However. passage of such leglslatlon thls year 15 1mprobable.
THE 92m: cousngss...
...reconvened on January 19 to start what leaders 1n both
houses hope H111 be an abbrevlated Second Sesslon.
Slghts are
set on adjournment by Labor Day.
In the envlronmental area two measures undoubtedly H111 be
enacted: water pollutlon and pestlcldes control.
The water b111, s. 2770, passed the Senate 1n November.
1::
House counterpart has been approved 1n prlnclple by the Publlc
Works CommlttEE, and passage by April 15 llkely.
The pestlclde b111, 3.x. 10729, passed the House last November.
Conslderatlon by the Senate Agrlculture Commlttee has not yet been
scheduled. but probably H111 be 1n the next month or so.
Enacti
men: 1n about 5114 months 15 posslble.

Toxlc substances leglslatlon, whlch 15 under conslderatlon
by the Senate Subcommlttee on the Envlronment under the actlng
llkely m be approved thls year even though a draft has been
prepared by commlttee staff and 15 55m to be ready for executlve
sesslon conslderatlon.
We have. however. complled wlth the request made by Senator
Spong durlng our testlmony last November 5.
In a letter dated
January 5, our Vlews were transmltted concernlng these aspects
of Amendment No. 339. 1n whlch we questloned both:
The adequacy and usefulness of the deflnltlon of
"chemlcal substances," as stated 1n Sectlon 202, and
The potentlal Value of a "provlslonal certlflcatlon
subject to recall" as a means of shortenlng the ad?
ministratlve delays 1nc1dent to full certlflcatlon.
In the consumer protectlon area, at least two measures probably
H111 become law:
5. 996, the Consumer Product Warrantles and Federal Trade Cami
mlsslon Improvement Act of 1971.
1: passed the Senate 1n November
and should get through the House m:nm the next few months.
And:
3.x. meas, the Consumer Protectlon Act of 1971, whlch passed
the House 1n October.
Th1: mu would create an 1ndependent Coni
sumer Protectlon Agency, and is expected to pass the Senate,
posslbly 1n 3 more strlngent com than the House Verslon.
There 15 less chance of completed actlon on product safety
leglslatlon. although a House Interstate and Forelgn Commerce
Subcommlttee 15 currently conductlng hearlngs on 3.x. sun, 3
product safety mm.
In the labor area, the flrst order of buslness 15 Senate
conslderatlon of the Equal Employment Dpportunlty Commlsslon
Floor debate began on January 19 and
actlon was expected to be completed by the end of the month.
A House measure concernlng thls subject passed that body 1n
September.
In that Verslon. 3.x. 9247, EEOC would have to
request court actlon to enforce "ceasemandideslst" orders.
Under the Senate b111, as reported by the Senate Labor and
Publlc Welfare CommlttEE, EEOC would have "ceasemandideslst"
powers.
Minimum wage 1 eglsl atlon 15 llkely m be enacted thls
sesslon.
3.x. 7130, reported by the House Educatlon and Labor
Commlttee 1n November, would boost the minimum wage to $2 an
hour.
The Senate Labor Subcommlttee has under conslderatlon
s. 1951 whlch would ralse the minimum wage to $2 an hour the
year of enactment, and $2.25 one year later.

Prl clples Appllcable to the Structure and Dperatlons of Commlttees"
1n 953, on his own 1n1tlatlve he 1nqu1red whether the requlrement
of 'merrbericompany fullitlme employee" for commlttee membershlp
wou d affect his status. General Hull, then MCA presldent, rul d
tha thls praiexlstlng menlbershlp could contlnue undlsturbed.
In 954, Alcoa nomlnated Donald (:1 WinsDn, a member of Mr.
Se ans' legal mm, as successor to Mr. Seamans. The record of
B05 d approval 1nd1cates only that Mr. Wlnson represents Alcoa,

not otherwlse settlng a precedent, and secondarlly 1n recognltlon
of ontlnulng need by the Commlttee for the servlces he 15 pecui
