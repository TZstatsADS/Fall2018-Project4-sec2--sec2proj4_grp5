STAFF REPORT
Ma rch 1972
by
William J. Driver
CONGRESSIONAL ACTION...
...involving portions of the Foreign Trade and Investment Act of
'1972 suddenly loomed as a possibility last week when it was learned
that the AFL-CIO planned to attempt attaching Titles VI and VII of
that proposed Act to the Administration's gold legislation.
Through agreement with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Wilbur D. Mills (D.-Ark.), the House Banking and Currency Committee
has been given jurisdiction over Titles VI and VII of the so-called
The latter committee scheduled gold bill hearings March 1-6 and,
immediately afterward, is expected to begin executive session mark­
Rapid enactment is anticipated.
Organized labor's position, to be presented the last day of hear­
ings, is that dollar devaluation in itself does not provide adequate
remedies and that the stronger measures embodied in the Hartke-Burke
bill are needed.
Title VI of that measure would empower the President to prohibit:
Any transactions involving direct or indirect transfer
of capital to or within any foreign country when, in
his judgment, the transfer would result in a net de­
crease in L). S. employment, and
Any holder of a U. S. patent from manufacturing the
patented product, using the patented process, licens­
ing others to manufacture the patented product or using
the patented process outside United States territory
when, in the President's judgment, such prohibition
will contribute to increased employment in the United
States .
Title VII would require onerous reporting provisions including
complete statistics on working conditions in multinational com­
panies outside the United States as well as or> products and their
distribution.
It also imposes burdensome requirements for labeling
and advertising.
After key House committee members were alerted to organized labor's
strategy, assurances were obtained that the gold legislation would
be kept free of encumbering amendments and that the Hartke-Burke
measures would be ruled non-germane.
On March 1, the Senate approved the gold legislation required by
the President to implement negotiated international monetary agree­
ments .

THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE ENVIRONMENT...
...has begun executive session consideration of pending toxic
substances legislation.
On February 11, the Subcommittee staff
made public Working Draft No. 1.
We were invited to submit for con­
sideration a memorandum dealing with Section 24 of that document.
It was prepared by our General Counsel and submitted on February 16.
Additional changes and improvements were recommended in more com­
prehensive comments on February 25 in a letter to the Acting Subcom­
mittee Chairman, Senator William B. Spong (D.-Va.).
We emphasized
our concern over certain provisions relative to premarket testing of
chemical substances and pointed out other needed improvements.
THE HOUSE PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE STAFF...
...has insisted for some time that the language of the pending
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments, H. R.1 1896, would
would be made public on March 1. However, present indications are
it will not be released until mid or late March. The Committee's
formal report is expected about the same time.
Consideration by the House Rules Committee will take place
prior to House floor action. The measure could reach Senate-House
conference before Easter.
A HOUSE-SENATE CONFERENCE...
...has approved legislation that would require the Equal Employ­
ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to seek court enforcement of its
findings of job discrimination.
Prompt approval by both houses and
President Nixon is expected.
The Senate version of the measure generally prevailed, broaden­
ing EE0C|s purview to government and educational employees as well
as reducing from 25 to 15 the number of workers in a company or
union coming under its jurisdiction.
A CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY BILL...
...which passed the House last October, is currently under con­
sideration in the Senate Government Operations Subcommittee on Exec­
utive Reorganization.
This bill, S. 1177, would establish an independent Consumer Pro­
tection Agency authorized to intervene on behalf of consumers in
any Federal agency where business regulation generally is at issue.
In addition, the new agency could seek judicial review of any de­
cision by a Federal agency that is considered to be contrary to the
interests of consumers.

Government
alerted MCA legislative contacts to the disruptive and
effects of this measure, suggesting that affected companies
their opposition--particularly to members of the Senate
Operations Committee.
The Executive Operations Subcommittee is expected to begin marking
up this bill within the next three or four weeks.
OVERSIGHT HEARINGS . . .
...on implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 were
held recently -- on January 26-28 by Representative Paul G. Rogers
(D.-Fla.), of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce
and on February 16-18, 23-25 by Senator Thomas F. Eagleton (D.-Mo.),
of the Senate Committee on Public Works.
Particular concern was expressed by Democratic members of the
Congress that the Office of Management and Budget (0MB) was inter­
ceding in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) affairs, contrary
to the intent of the Congress.
Persistently attacked was EPA's
delay in issuing state "Requirements for Preparation, Adoption,
and Submittal of Implementation Plans."
EPA's Administrator,
Mr. Ruckelshaus, had delayed their publication in order to revise
them.
He deleted implications that approval of state plans would
depend on inclusion of specified regulatory provisions and clearly
identified them as possible state options, thus allowing for alter­
native control strategies.
Democrats and environmentalists alleged this change was the
result of political pressures applied through 0MB.
However, Mr.
Ruckelshaus defended the legal and technological soundness of his
actions.
AS INDICATED IN THE FEBRUARY REPORT...
...written testimony developed by our International Trade
Committee has been presented to the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign
Commerce and Tourism in connection with their hearings on S. 2754,
the Export Expansion Act of 1971.
By letter on February 29 to the Committee's Chairman, Senator
Daniel K. Inouye (D.-Hi.), we reiterated our position on:
Upgrading commercial attaches,
Using industry advisors during trade negotiations,
Strengthening Export-Import Bank operations.
Easing restraints on bank export financing.
Ending freight rate disparities,
Permitting more activities in foreign trade zones.
Easing access to drawback opportunities,
Ending foreign direct investment controls, and on
Qualifying all export earnings for DISC operations.

Two specific recommendations were to:
1) Require, by law, government use of business
advisors in international trade negotiations.
2) Subsidize directly, rather than indirectly, operation
of the U. S. Merchant Marine as a means of ending freight
rate disparities.
...were the topic at a meeting on February 24 at MCA Headquarters.
Discussion centered on reported findings of medical researchers con­
cerning phthalate extraction by blood when stored in bags made of
phthalate-plasticized polyvinyl chloride film, and observances of
birth defects in rats when injected with types of phthalate esters
used as plasticizers in plastics, particularly polyvinyl chloride.
Forty-five representatives of 31 companies attended.
They wish
to consider the development of a technical program, and eight com­
panies volunteered representatives as an Ad Hoc Planning Group on
Phthalate Studies, with the understanding that any program proposal #
involving MCA administration would require your approval.
THE ASSOCIATION...
...has extended its agreement with The University of Michigan to
maintain a registry of cases of acroosteolysis (fingertip bone lesions)
and to provide a consultation center for industry.

Funded by contributions from 19 polyvinyl chloride manufacturers,
the extension continues a program which began with an extensive in­
vestigation of the clinical, epidemiological, and industrial hygiene
aspects of this syndrome among polyvinyl chloride production workers.
...as a pollution-prevention measure, has proposed regulations
concerning the design and construction of vessels and the operation
of terminal facilities in oil transfer operations.
In general, member companies have no objection to the proposal.
However, since we believe some modification is necessary to provide
for appropriate review, preserve uniformity with present regulations
and clarify intent of some of the proposals, our comments were sub­
mitted to the Coast Guard on February 15.
THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION...
CMA 036193
...scheduled a modified procedure in response to our complaint
concerning deficiencies in the tank car mileage allowance system
adopted by railroads, requesting written comment by February 22.
However, that date did not allow us sufficient time and our request
for a 90-day extension was granted.
We may ultimately request
oral argument if the modified procedure appears inadequate to as­
sure a complete record.

Two new booklets are upcoming.
A career guidance booklet, "A
Challenge For Growth," will replace "Careers Ahead In The Chemical
Industry." And, "What Is Chemical Change" is currently being dis­
tributed in experimental form prior to publication. Authored by
Elbert C. Weaver, it presents lecture demonstrations for elementary
schools.
The Association's combined Education-Consumer Information Exhibit
elicited substantial interest and discussion at the Annual Conven­
tion of the American Association of School Administrators in Atlantic
City, February 12-16.
The same exhibit will be on display March 5-8
in Philadelphia at the Annual Convention of The Association for
Supervision and Curriculum Development and at the Annual Convention
of the National Science Teachers' Association in New York City, April
Two symposia, in recognition of the MCA Centennial, will be co­
sponsored by the Association and the American Chemical Society on
April 10 and 12 during the latter's Annual Convention in Boston.
One, under the Division of Chemical Education, Inc, will feature a
discussion on continuing education.
The other, under the Division
of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, will be devoted to "Indus­
trial-Academic Cooperation in the Seventies."
On April 13, the day before a scheduled Education
Activities
Committee (EAC) meeting, EAC members will participate in an Inter­
face Conference with the ECIS* group of students at the Massachusetts

CMA03611
Finally, the EAC, through MCA's Manager of Education, Dr. Robert
E. Varnerin, is collaborating with the National Science Foundation
(NSF) in proposing an Experimental Research and Development Incen­
tives Program for NSF funding.
If approved by the Congress, the
program will promote the exchange of personnel between industry and
schools on a sabbatical or internship basis and provide R 4 D funds
for non-defense research in industry.
A budget of $22 million has
been proposed.
Proposed
Research Program
on
Mechanisms of Phosgene Injury to the Lungs
EXHIBIT A
Purpose
The purpose of this program, to be collectively funded by voluntary sub­
scriptions from interested companies, is to provide information on the basic
mechanisms Involved in phosgene damage to the lungs. This information is a
prerequisite for the determination of a reconmended method of medical treat­
ment of industrial exposures to phosgene.
Initial Project
As recommended by the Ad Hoc Task Group on Phosgene Safety composed of
representatives of interested member companies, the lnaediate project is that
defined in the proposal made by Or. M. F, Frosolono of the.Mt. Sinai Hospital
of Cleveland in a letter to MCA dated August 23, 1972. This project Is to be
conducted under contracts (a) between MCA and Mt. Sinai Hospital of Cleveland,
not to exceed $30,000 and (b) between MCA and Dr. Frosolono for consulting fees
regarding the research referred to in (a), not to exceed $3,000.
Supervision
This research is to be supervised on MCA's behalf by a Technical Task Group
composed of one technical representative from each subscribing company plus an
MCA staff representative to serve as secretary.
Organizationally within MCA, the Task Group is to function under the Juris­
diction of the Safety and Fire Protection Comnittee.
Funding
Consnitments have been made by thirteen interested companies in support of
this research, up to $3,500 per company. Funds are to be collected in advance
of commitments, and disbursements subject to MCA staff clearance and approval.
Stipulations
The scientific information developed from this program is to be fully dis­
closed without restriction. For purposes of consistency and control, however,
all releases are to be made through MCA only, normally based on Task Force recom­
mendations as to nature and timing. This requirement is not to preclude pri­
vate scientific Interchange of non'competitive information which will be useful,
nor relevant private cosnunlcation among subscribing companies and organizations;
the staff representative to be informed of all such interchanges and communications.
Operation
The Task Group will be governed by MCA's "General Principles Applicable to
the Structure and Operations of Conmittees" and the Rules of Organization and
Procedure of the Safety and Fire Protection Committee.

Report of
Education Activities Committee
to
Manufacturing Chemists Association
November 20, 1972
By Henry W. Rahn, Chairman
It is three years since the EAC Committee last reported directly to this Board.
In the interim, several significant developments have occurred affecting the area
wherein the Committee functions - namely, the industrial-academic interface. These
include: first - employment opportunities for new technical graduates in the chemical
industry shrank to low levels; seeond - a wave of technical staff reductions by job
termination ran through the industry in 1970 and 1971; and third - society's attitude
toward our industry underwent deterioration to where we now labor under the burden of
a negative public image. It is most appropriate, therefore, and I welcome this op­
portunity to review for you the Committee's objectives, plans and activities, structured
to meet our assignment and responsibility to the MCA under conditions so changed from
the past.
COMMITTEE EVOLUTION
The Committee was first established in the mid 50's when, as you will recall, there
was a shortage of graduate chemists. The initial objective was to encourage students
i pursue a career in chemistry, so as to assure an adequate supply of chemists for the
xpanding needs of our industry.
Until the mid 60's, the Committee continued to follow a program of recruiting students
into chemistry. But then some red flags went up, when careful reviews of technical
graduate supply-demand studies lad several of our members to predict that the high post
World War II birth rates would result in an oversupply of chemists in the early 70's. The
rough coincidence of this graduate oversupply timing, with the economic downturn of the
chemical industry beginning in 1969, and the layoffs of employed chemists and chemical
engineers which ensued, accelerated the rate at which the oversupply of unemployed
ch mically-trained persons was growing. As of earlier this year, 25% of all chemists 26
years of age or less were unemployed. Faced with these unsettling aspects in the job
market, the Committee decided to modify its objectives. Instead of stressing recruitment,
we began to focus on the quality and type of training suitable for chemists going into
industry.
CMA 036213
FUTURE TECHNICAL MANPOWER SUPPLY-DEMAND RELATIONSHIP
In looking ahead, we are confronted with a highly confused picture concerning the
future demand-supply relationship for new graduate scientific and engineering man­
power. Major long-range studies reaching into the 1980's by such prestigious groups
as the National Science Foundation, Scientific Manpower Commission, Engineering
Manpower Commission of the Joint Engineers Council and the U. S. Department of
Labor reach varying forecasts, ranging from prediction of years of oversupply to dire
warnings of impending shortages.
Perhaps this is to be expected as the nation grapples with the problem of changing
priorities and shifting activities. And in view of this, it would appear that the use of
historical trend data for predicting technical manpower supplies ten years from now forces
some degree of uncertainty into the forecasts. But the weight of the evidence seems to
lie on the side of an impending shortage. The short-range forecasts, on the other hand,
as mode by similarly competent groups, are considered to be much more reliable. We
can discuss these figures with more confidence. In general, such studies predict we
will experience a sharp downward trend in B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees awarded in
chemistry and all engineering during the next four years.
If this downward trend continues, there is reason to believe that a shortage of some
proportions could develop in the supply of scientific and engineering graduates. As
responsible members of the chemical industry, I believe there is cause for us to be
- concerned over both the short and long range situation. I will not burden you with a
complete statistical analysis that supports this conclusion, but here are some significant
details.
First, undergraduate enrollments for majors in chemistry have historically increased
modestly each year. In 1970, however, the number of ft.. S. degrees awarded in
chemistry declined for the first time in 20 years. We conclude that a high "drop out"
rate between entry and graduation for chemistry majors has taken place.
Second, the number of first year graduate students in Ph.D. chemistry programs has
declined 25% since 1966. Statistics for each year indicate an increased number of
students who earn a degree in chemistry only as a "stepping stone" to careers in other
fields.
Third, undergraduate enrollments and earned degrees in engineering are declining
significantly. From the total engineering bachelor supply of 43,000 graduating in
1971, the output in 1975 is expected to fall to 31,000.
Against this background of rapidly-declining interest in scientific and engineering
degrees, there are some that claim that even larger decreases in the employed technical
woricforce may be necessary, as an adjustment to changing R & D priorities. If this be­
comes nee ssary, I susp ct w will find the students moving ever farther away from the
chemical industry, a developm nt we would all like to avoid if possible.
CMA 036214
The chemical industry, as you well know, is an industry of great complexity,
requiring many high level intellects to effectively develop, manage and operate
the enterprise. Our future ability to attract such individuals in the numbers required
will depend largely on the prestige of the occupation, working conditions and personal
opportunities for growth.
In attempting to assess future requirements for new graduate chemists and chemical
engineers, we make the prediction this number will remain a reasonably stable percentage
f the total industrial workforce. At the risk of oversimplification, we have reached this
conclusion by assuming two important opposing demand trends will tend to balance each
other. The downward trend involved R/D. During the past 25 years, i^ft activities
accounted for a large fraction of total technical employment. With this fraction tending
to become smaller, as R/D is de-emphasized, one can logically reason future needs for
chemists and chemical engineers in this area will diminish. On the other hand, an
upward trend involving newly-emerging problem areas, such as environmental control
and the impending energy crisis, which heretofore have not been factors of any signifi­
cance as users or chemically trained personnel, could possibly impose heavy future de­
mands against supply, offsetting losses in the I^D sector of the chemical industry. Con­
sequently, we believe continued reductions in chemistry and engineering majors and
earned degrees will likely leadto shortages of technical graduate manpower resources.
In view of the uncertainty surrounding future needs, it is tempting to adopt a "wait and
see" attitude. The Committee counsels against this, because to do so will undermine
the attractiveness of chemistry and the chemical industry as a oareer choice for students.
. Further, it will likely intensify the negative image many students and young faculty,
specially in non-science areas, have for the chemical and other technically-oriented
industry. And above all, we must bear in mind that the manpower problems we anticipate
in four or eight years are, in fact, today's problems because the new chemists and engineers
' we will hire then are in the educational pipeline now.
RESTORATION OF CONFIDENCE IN INDUSTRY
If you agree with me that there has indeed been a loss of confidence by the student body
in our industry, the question then arises as to what steps we can take to restore it. We
of the Committee feel this is a serious matter that should be promptly dealt with in some
positive way. In conjunction with the Public Relations Committee, we are organizing an
effort to define a program for your consideration. Meanwhile, I urge you to give, with
us, serious consideration to this matter so that the MCA and the industry can have an
important continuing influence on the educational system and on national manpower
planning commissions.
OBJECTIVES - PLANS - ACTIVITIES - ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Against the foregoing background, I would now like to report on our current programs
and activities. In 1971, the Board approved a realignment of our objectives and function
according t the greatly altered mployment and economic eonditi ns confr nting member
companies. Our objective became: "To promote through the educational system
public understanding of the chemical industry; to assist in career guidance; to enhance
the quality of education in chemistry, chemical engineering and interdisciplinary
fields related to chemistry; to promote the teaching of chemistry and related sciences
in a broad intellectual, cultural and social context at all levels of education." We
thus reaffirmed our primary mission to collaborate with educators and educational
systems. Our activities were then reorganized and channeled into three categories,
all judged to be of importance in attaining our objectives. These are:
Q
I
i
career guidance
chemical education
public understanding of the chemical industry
Each area of concern is assigned to a separate mibcommittee. Concerning their work,
the following is of interest.
CAREER GUIDANCE SUBCOMMITTEE
This group finds itself in the paradoxical situation of motivating students toward chemistry
at a time when trained scientists are unemployed. This contrasts with a past period of
more than two decades when expansion and growth of the industry assured multiple job
opportunities for each new chemist. Employment prospects prevailing at the time a
student made a career decision remained essentially unchanged 4 or 8 or 10 years later
when he entered the job market. Specialization was the "name of the game"; career
objectives for specific positions could be described succinctly in terms of course require­
ments and skills. Career guidance was then a very legitimate facet of recruitment in
advance, when there are concrete job openings. Only recently have some associations,
professional societies and companies abandoned this activity in view of changed conditions.
Some few years ago the Career Guidance Subcommittee began to redirect its efforts to
give greater emphasis to the variety of tasks performed in the chemical industry. There
is a continuing need for people with a chemical background but, as you know, the ap­
plication of their education and training might not conform to the traditional and
academic image of the chemist or chemical engineer. The subcommittee encourages
those with particular ability and interest in chemistry to a career in R & D. However,
for most in industry, the translation of theoretical information into practical realities
such as administration, marketing, personnel, liaison with government and public re­
lations defines “where the action is." Consequently, an education should be directed
to the broad spectrum of job opportunities and develop the individual interests and
skills of the student.
Several experimental career booklets were developed to present the new approach to
more than 4,500 educators, students and administrators who requested copies. A new
edition of the booklet will be distributed early next year, incorporating many helpful
suggesti ns received from teachers and students.
CMA 036216
|t is courageous to phase out old and luccessful programs and innovate when our
career guidance efforts rode the crest of the wave of acceptance among educators
and students. During the 1971-1972 fiscal year, for example, we filled requests
for more than 30,000 career booklets and 10,000 flyers. It is preferable, as you
will agree, to be ahead of change rather than unwitting victims of it.
This subcommittee also assists and encourages the increased number of those who
elect chemistry as a cultural background or as a foundation for careers in fields
such as medicine, law and marketing which have competing claims on technicallytrained men and women.
CHEMICAL EDUCATION SUBCOMMITTEE
This group spearheads efforts to influence chemical education. As a measure of our
success and acceptance among academic chemists during the past two years, members
f our committee have been participants by invitation at three major chemical education
conferences and at tke White House Conference on Youth. In the past year, we
collaborated, by invitation, with the National Science Foundation in the preliminary
planning and implementation of a new educational program in which industry and the
academe will jointly study the process of innovation and of expediting the process by
which new ideas are transferred into curricula or marketable products.
The work of this subcommittee is now focused in three areas:
College and High School Teacher Awards
Influence on Curricula
Interface Conferences
' College Awards; Since 19S7, MCA has honored 75 outstanding professors of chemistry
and chemical engineering. As one of the foremost national awards on the college level
in the U.S. and Canada, the program has attained prestige and is considered by many
r cent recipients as the pinnacle of their teaching careers.
In 1972, the six medalists were featured in a cover study in Chemical and Engineering
News and a cover headline in the Journal of Chemical Education, a first for MCA in
each of these magazines. In 1972, we received more than 430 inquiries and processed 182
nominations; both figures represent a high for the program. As of this date, we have proe ssed 294 inquiries and 74 nominations for the 1973 program.
V*IT
In the last two years we conferred five college awards on the campus of the recipient.
S veral of you represented MCA at these ceremonies and contributed to this new
dimension of industry-education contact. As a result of these campus ceremonies,
several major institutions re-evaluated their programs honoring excellence among their
faculty, another plans to initiate an honors convocation and another broke an old
tradition and gave public notice of the award at commencement.
CMA 036217
6
Our college awards have been one of our least expensive but highest return
activities.
High School Awards: Since 1964, MCA has honored more than 199 secondary school
teachers with local awards of $200. The program, administered by Chemical Industry
Councils, was restricted to teachers within the locale of the council. In 1973,
we will open the program, making any teacher in the U.S. and Canada eligible for
a regional award of $200 or for the new national award of $1,000. The expanded
program has aroused an enthusiastic response. To date, we have processed 66 requests
for information and nomination forms.
Influence on Curricula; For almost 10 years the Chemical Education Subcommittee
has promoted the inclusion of practical chemistry from industry into chemistry courses
on the high school and lower college levels. When we first made the suggestion, our
message went unheeded among educators who intensified the theoretical content of
their chemistry courses. Recently, other associations, professional societies, major
chemical education conferences and educators concur with our proposal. We collaborate
with educators to ensure that the industrial world of chemistry is a necessary adjunct to
theory.
In 1967, the first title in a 10 book, MCA-sponsored "Chemistry in Action Series" was
published by Doubleday. The books related practical stories and personal accounts of
the world of industry. Almost 100,000 copies, like the two samples I have here, have
been sold to enrich high school and lower level college chemistry courses. Eight of
these titles appear in foreign language editions similar to this Japanese version of
Water is Everybody's Business, and one title in a U.S. Information Service edition in
Ind ia. the ftooks beportment of the American Chemical Society now publishes the
series. We cooperate in enlisting authors and assisting in the preparation of manuscripts .
Since 1961, Holt, Rinehard and Winston published four MCA-sponsored innovative
laboratory manuals for elementary and secondary schools. More than 165,000 copies
have been sold. MCA is widely known and esteemed for this service. We will request
modest funding to up-date one of these manuals in the next fiscal year.
We canvassed member companies and mode significant suggestions for the Objectives
and Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Chemistry for the Committee on Prof ssional Training of ACS. John Howard of Kodak, member of both our and the ACS
committee, summarized and submitted our recommendations. In the past six months,
the chairman of the ACS committee acknowledged our contributions before more than 300
chairmen of college chemistry departments and, on another occasion, before more than 450
educators.
Interface Conferences; We initiated experimental and innovative conferences of
students, educators and industrial people. We have seen the effectiveness and
predict an increasing need for this type of dialog. Members of the subcommittee share
their exp rience with member companies who have organized similar sessions.

PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY SUBCOMMITTEE
The third and newest subcommittee of the Education Activities Committee promotes
gr ater public understanding of the chemical industry through the educational system.
Their efforts are directed primarily to the non-science student and faculty who harbor
a negative attitude toward technically-oriented industry. Many of these apostles,
to be sure, have the naivete of youth but share with us in industry a bigness of concern
f r society. Their zeal and energies seek direction toward constructive as well as
destructive goals. Though some would "write off" this group as ignorant, our contact
with them through interface seminars indicates that they have done their homework well
but often lack an over-all and balanced view of a particular problem. They are un­
informed, for the most part, of the accomplishments of industry for society. However,
they are open and willing to learn and change their attitudes.
The subcommittee coordinates its efforts with Mrs. Walton's Consumer Information
Subcommittee. We make suitable education materials available to Mrs. Walton's
committee and distribute their materials designed to educate the general public
through our education channels. On three occasions we combined the Consumer Inf rmation and Education exhibits to stretch our exhibit dollars and to reach new audiences
f science and non-science oriented publics. At the suggestion of the Consumer Information
group, we published a manual of simple chemical demonstrations suitable for the general
public and have another manual of simple food experiments in the rough manuscript staga.
MCA's education exhibit provides us the opportunity to present all our programs and
t discuss them with educators. This past year more than 2,500 educators visited our
booth at one regional and three national education conferences. This year we have
scheduled six exhibits in all sections of the U.S. and seek similar contacts with
Canadian educators.
The two subcommittees also coordinated their efforts in presenting the seminar
"Catalyst '72 — Is Science Necessary”?, which I hope many of you were able to
attend this morning.
The impact of electronic media on this generation indicates that the printed word
is no longer the only effective avenue of communication. An experimental tape
for campus radio, classroom or private listening was produced. Film clips, slide
lectures and audio courses are some of the means of communication which we will
propose to you for future budget allocations.
As I indicated earlier, there is on the drawing boards a joint task force with the Public
Relations Committee to study the negative image of industry among youth and make
recommendations on what industry can do to stem the tide of unfair criticism which, as
you know, often creates the unfavorable climate for adverse and restrictive legislation.
Our work, like public relations, is never ending. There is no such thing as a stable or
one-time public. Publics are like rivers - more water always feeding into a stream
which never stands still and n ver is quite the same at any one point of reference.
CMA 036219
Thii about brings ma to the and of my report.
Before closing, I would like to thank you, the member companies who are represented
on the Committee and the staff of the MCA, for the strong support given the EAC.
The Committee membership is listed in the new MCA directory. The individuals named
and the MCA staff form a team of highly motivated, dedicated, competent professionals
of varied disciplines giving great breadth of experience to our work. From a purely
personal point of view, may I say it is both a pleasure and a privilege to work with
them.
In this brief report, I have listed only the highlights of our problems, accomplishments
and future plans. I am sure that you have many other questions related to our work. I
will be happy to respond either before you adjourn this meeting or later.
I thank you.

The purpose of this program is to provide scientific
information to clarify the status of vinyl chloride (monomer)
in reference to carcinogenicity.
Proj ect
As recommended by an Ad Hoc Planning Group for Vinyl
Chloride Research, composed of representatives of eight MCA
member companies, the project is to contract for animal test­
ing research under which experimental animals would inhale
vinyl chloride monomer vapor at selected concentration levels
and be examined in accord with an agreed-upon testing and
examination protocol.
Planned duration of the project is
three years.
According to quotations from Industrial Bio-Test
Laboratories, Inc., with which the contract is in prospect,
and an allowance for vinyl chloride supply and contingencies,
the projected cost is $193,000.
Funding
Funding commitments have been received from seventeen
MCA member companies sufficient in the aggregate to cover the
stated cost. Company shares are pro-rated on the basis of
publicly announced tonnage production capacity for vinyl
chloride monomer plus polyvinyl chloride.
Disbursements are to be subject to MCA staff clearance
and approval.
Supervision
The program is to be supervised on MCA's behalf by a
Technical Task Group on Vinyl Chloride Research composed of
one technical representative from each subscribing company,
plus an MCA staff representative to serve as secretary.
Administratively, the Task Group is to function under
the jurisdiction of the Occupational Health Committee.
CMA 036228
Stipulations
The scientific information developed from this program
is to be fully disclosed, without restriction.
For purposes
of consistency and control, however, all releases are to be
made solely through MCA, normally based on Task Group rec­
ommendations as to nature and timing.
This requirement would
not preclude private scientific interchange of non-competitive
information useful to advancement of the program, nor relevant
private communication within and among subscribing companies.
It would be an obligation to inform the MCA staff representa­
tive on a current basis about all such related interchanges
and communications other than those internal to the company.
Operation
The Task Group is to be governed by the requirements of
MCA's "General Principles Applicable to the Structure and Op­
erations of Committees" and the Rules of Organization and Pro­
cedure of the Occupational Health Committee.

TAX REFORM...hearings before the House Ways and
mittee are likely to begin early in the next session
As long ago as last June, that Committee's Chairman,
Mills (D.-Ark.), indicated the issue would be number
ority.
Means Com­
of Congress.
Wilbur
one pri­
Less certain is the nature and scope of such hearings.
While various members of Congress have announced that they will
sponsor "loophole-plugging" bills. Mills has avoided advocating
sweeping reforms.
The Administration is expected to introduce its tax reform
proposal early in order to take the initiative.
Comments by
various Treasury Department officials indicate the Administra­
tion will emphasize tax simplification rather than substantive
reform.
Treasury Under Secretary Edwin S. Cohen stated recently
that he expected Congress to take under consideration the Asset
Depreciation Range (ADR) system, the investment taut credit, and
the minimum tax on tax preference income.
It is also expected
that capital gains will come up for congressional review.
Some Administration officials have been advocating early
Congressional consideration of trade reform legislation ahead of
tax legislation, both of which are handled by the House Ways
and Means Committee. Mr. Mills is reported to have indicated
that he would put trade legislation before tax reform if President
Nixon should request it. We understand, however, that the
President has not yet made a decision on either the nature of
trade legislation to be proposed by the Administration, or on
the tactical issue of when to present it.
TRADE POLICY...in the new Nixon Administration will operate
under new leadership.
The President has indicated that, in addition to his Cabinet
duties, Treasury Secretary Shultz will take charge of overall
economic policy.
The imminent departure of Commerce Secretary Peterson should
restore the Department of State to some eminence in trade policy
matters.
No changes have been indicated so far in the Office of the
Special Trade Representative.
However, the President has
accepted r signations from a number of International Economic
Policy Council staff memb rs, presently headed by Peter Flanigan.

THE CONTROVERSY...over tank car mileage allowances continues.
On November 24, the railroads filed a reply to statements by
MCA and other intervenors with the Interstate Commerce Commission
The railroads:
Resist updating of base classification values (BCV's) ,
attacking the basic system and claiming that a single
percentage trending factor is inappropriate,
Criticized our proposal to raise the value ceiling to
$40,000, contending that linings and special materials
relate to the "package" function of a tank car, and
Continued legal objections to ICC's power to prescribe
specific allowances.
The railroad document was lengthy.
Therefore, to permit
adequate evaluation and response, additional time to comment was
requested in our behalf and that of the American Petroleum
Institute, car lining companies and other supporters.
Four
weeks were granted; reply statements are now due January 8, 1973.
NIOSH...the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health, is conducting a National Occupational Hazard Survey —
a statistical study designed to collect pertinent information
regarding biological, physical and chemical exposures to indus­
trial workers. Accompanied by management representatives, NIOSH
surveyors tour industrial plants, noting exposures to different
occupational groups.
Seventy-five percent of the data collected is reported as
exposures to trade name compounds.
However, the Institute's
ultimate goal is to develop information on exposures to specific
chemicals, not trade name products.
Therefore, NIOSH desires
ingredient information for each trade name item reported to
them.
To obtain this information they propose to send a letter
and a "request form" (one for each trade name product) to about
5000 manufacturers.
Response would be mandatory.
There is obvious concern that trade secret information
might leak from the NIOSH files.
Therefore a panel meeting
under the Office of Management and Budget is being arranged,
and MCA companies will have an opportunity to express their
views regarding the need for assurances of confidentiality
beyond those already expressed in the Occupational Safety and
Health Act.

Proposed
Epidemiological Study on Vinyl Chloride
Supplementary to the animal testing program on
vinyl chloride (monomer) approved in January 1973 for
MCA administration, there is a desire to proceed now
with an epidemiological study of the medical records of
industrially exposed workers.
Companies that are also supporting the animal
testing program have volunteered funds on the same sub­
scription basis to defray anticipated costs ranging
from a probable minimum of $72,000 up to a tentatively
estimated maximum of about $92,000.
Tabershaw-Cooper Associates, Inc., Berkeley,
Calif., has been chosen to conduct the study, after
consideration of several candidates.
A time period of
eight months has been projected.
Management of the project on behalf of MCA would
follow the same pattern as provided for the animal
testing program.

FINAL REPORT
The objective of this committee, formed at the February-Executive
Committee meeting, was to study how to make MCA more effective, with
particular reference to, but not limited to, Washington and government
relations. A preliminary report was made to the Executive Committee
and to the Board in March, and several suggestions were approved.
The committee feels that this report represents only a first step
towards strengthening MCA and that the effectiveness of MCA ought to be
reviewed annually by the Executive Committee and the Board.
Discussions with a cross section of Board members, MCA staff,
and member company personnel serving on MCA committees and on the
Washington scene pointed to a central need and opportunity to improve
communications. The committee believes MCA's communications can be
improved in a number of areas by eliminating layering, sharpening objec­
tives, focusing efforts on key groups, and coordinating the activities of
various parts of the Association.
Therefore, the following steps are recommended to strengthen
MCA's communications:1
1. The agenda for Board meetings should be revamped to include
additional reports from chairmen of technical and functional committees,
a regular review of legislative activity by the Director of Government Re­
lations, and periodic reports from other MCA staff members, as set forth
in the recommended agenda attached as Exhibit A. The four Board Liaison
Committees should be eliminated. Also, the scene should be set in a way
CMA 036303
that will permit pointed questioning regarding, and critical discussion of,
MCA affairs.
2. At least two more Board meetings should be held each year in
Washington to focus attention on governmental matters and to facilitate con­
tacts with government personnel. A recommended schedule of Board meet­
ings for 1973-74 is attached as Exhibit B.
3. Closer communication between Executive Contacts, especially
thoae who are MCA Board members, and personnel from their companies
who serve on technical and functional committees is very much in order and
needs to be encouraged.
4. The Executive Committee, in conformity with suggested changes
in Board procedures and in addition to its present activities, should make an
annual review of MCA1 a effectiveness, including the work of, as well as the
need for, the various committees. Any action which would have a significant
financial impact should be decided upon prior to January, when development
of the budget begins. The Executive Committee should also formulate a list
of the most critical issues facing the industry and indicate those issues for
which MCA positions should be developed.
A letter should be sent from the Chairman of the Board to all
Executive Contacts following the June 1973 Greenbrier meeting outlining the
newly adopted approaches and procedures for the 1973-74 MCA year, and
soliciting their active interest and participation.
Board Meetings
The agenda for Board meetings will be prepared by the President,
following consultation as appropriate with the Chairman of the Board and
sent to the Directors well in advance of meetings. Routine business of the
Association should be dealt with briefly on the assumption that Directors had
read the material which was supplied prior to the meeting.
Of considerable importance is the arrangement of the agenda in such
a way that there can be appropriate questioning and discussion regarding
important MCA matters. At some past meetings, several Board members
have felt the opportunity for meaningful discussion was limited or precluded.
Providing for frank deliberation will permit a fuller contribution from the
Board and will recognize the considerable investment of time by Board mem­
bers. However, this increased participation by the Board in MCA affairs
should not be permitted to diminish the role and the effectiveness of the Ex­
ecutive Committee.
The President would present first an overview of MCA's situation,
providing perspective and priorities with regard to important issues, op­
portunities, and problems.
CMA 036304
This would be'followed by a brief legislative report from the
Director of Government Relations plus reports from any other members
of the MCA staff who have an important matter to bring to the Board's
attention.
Next, three or four chairmen of technical or functional com­
mittees would report on substantive matters pending in those committees.
Routine organizational matters and accomplishments should be excluded.
The four Board Liaison Committees have helped a great deal, but there
is a prevailing opinion that the growing complexity and importance of the
issues the industry is facing require the active and direct involvement of
the Board, and that to shorten communications lines the liaison Commit­
tees should be dissolved.
One-third of the 24 MCA committees currently have chairmen
from companies which are not represented on the Board. When one of
these chairmen reports to the Board, the Executive Contact from his com­
pany should be invited to attend the meeting.
The above format would normally take two hours, and this time
should be regularly allotted in planning schedules.
Two more Washington Board meetings (January and October)
would improve communications considerably. Such meetings would also
help focus Board attention on the critical matters in the governmental
area, and provide an opportunity the night before the Board meeting for
members to have dinner with government people. The successful Chemical
Forum luncheons would be tied in the next day. Good staff work and coor­
dinated efforts are called for here to see that MCA interests are effectively
conveyed to the government.
With regard to regional Board meetings, the Program Commit­
tee ought to devote special attention to increasing their value to those at­
tending by providing a program which contributes insight into regional
industry interests, especially governmental activities.
Government Relations Activity
Communications among the Government Relations staff, other
MCA staff members, the technical and functional committees, and Wash­
ington representatives of member companies should be improved through
more formalized procedures.
In the past, MCA has been stymied at times by an inability to
reach unanimous agreement in the various committees on what position to
take and by a cumbersome clearance procedure. In the future, commit­
tees should try to proceed promptly to a decision and where unanimity is
unattainable, majority and minority views should be referred to the Execu­
tive Committee for consideration.

Proposed Ret ntion of Economic Consultant to Supply the
Economic Data for the chemical Industry's Position on
the Industrial Reorganization Act (Hart Bill - S. 1167)
LEGAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE
ECONOMIC POLICY REVIEW COMMITTEE
senator Hart has introduced a bill (S. 1167) intended to facili­
tate the breaking-up of large corporations in a number of industries,
including the chemical industry. Hearings before his Subcommitt e
cn Antitrust and Monopoly of the Senate Judiciary Committee began
L?st year and will continue during this year and next.
There have
already been two series of hearings on the general merits or demer­
its of the bill, and one series devoted to communications, parti­
cularly the Bell System.
A series on the automobile industry will
begin February 26.
The chemical industry is not likely to have its
day in court for many months to come.
While there is little prospect of the enactment of S. 1167 in
its present form, there is a danger that some elements of it may
become law.
Moreover, the Hart hearings are a forum in which major
industries are under public attack, and the chemical industry should
be ready to- defend itself.
It is not possible at this point to pre­
dict the character of the hearings on our industry. As in the case
of the Bell System, one major company may be chosen for attack.
»5 seems likely to be the case with the motor industry, our ‘entire
industry may be exposed to rigorous review.
It is not known at prebent whether MCA will be asked to appear—nor has it been decided
whether, if not asked, MCA would choose to volunteer its testimony.
However, it seems to the above committees the course of prudence
to be prepared for all contingencies. Accordingly, we propose that
MCA engage prof. Steven Lustgarten of Baruch college as a consultant
to assemble and organise data demonstrating that the chemical indus­
try is not in need of deconcentration under Senator Hart's proposed
"Industrial Reorganisation Act" - that it is, in fact, highly com­
petitive, open to new entrants, and a force restraining rather than
sustaining inflation (the detailed proposal of Prof. Lustgarten is
appended).
The proposal is budgeted for a cost of $17,637. This figure
does not include the cost of printing.
The decision whether to
print the study and in what form is a separate question, to be
decided when it is completed.

Ui6.6'5
PRESIDENT NIXON...
...in his State of the Union message, emphasised the Admin­
istration's legislative proposals which were introduced last
year and on which congressional action has not yet been com­
pleted.
Specifically, the President urged the Congress to
take early action on welfare reform, health services, revenue
sharing, the environment, consumer protection and transporta­
tion.
In addition to stressing the need for action on proposed en­
vironmental legislation, the President stated he would soon be
sending to the Congress a message on the environment that would
present "further administrative and legislative initiatives."
The President also indicated that he would soon propose new legis-*
lation concerning:
A new technology program, with federal
increase private research, and
incentives to
Federally supported research on a range of projects
designed "to improve our everyday lives."
Another area involving new legislative proposals concerns edu­
cation.
The President stated he would recommend later in the
year a new way of financing public schools to supplant reliance
on local property taxes.
While no details were given, it is under­
stood the Administration has been studying the concept of a valueadded tax as a means of raising revenue to pay for local schools.
However, passage of such legislation this year is improbable.
THE 92ND CONGRESS...
...reconvened on January 18 to start what leaders in both
houses hope will be an abbreviated Second Session.
Sights are
set on adjournment by Labor Day.
In the environmental area two measures undoubtedly will be
enacted: water pollution and pesticides control.
The water bill, S. 2770, passed the Senate in November.
Its
House counterpart has been approved in principle by the Public
Works Committee, and passage by April is likely.
The pesticide bill, H.R. 10729, passed the House last November.
Consideration by the Senate Agriculture Committee has not yet been
scheduled, but probably will be in the next month or so.
Enact­
ment in about six months is possible.
CMA 036161
Toxic substances legislation, which is under consideration
by the Senate Subcommittee on the Environment under the acting
likely to be approved this year even though a draft has been
prepared by committee staff and is said to be ready for executive
session consideration.
We have, however, complied with the request made by Senator
Spong during our testimony last November 5.
In a letter dated
January 5, our views were transmitted concerning these aspects
of Amendment No. 338. in which we questioned both:
The adequacy and usefulness of the definition of
"chemical substances," as stated in Section 202, and
The potential value of a "provisional certification
subject to recall" as a means of shortening the ad­
ministrative delays incident to full certification.
In the consumer protection area, at least two measures probably
will become law:
S. 986, the Consumer Product Warranties and Federal Trade Com­
mission Improvement Act of 1971.
It passed the Senate in November
and should get through the House within the next few months.
And,
H.R. 10835, the Consumer Protection Act of 1971, which passed
the House in October.
This bill would create an independent Con­
sumer Protection Agency, and is expected to pass the Senate,
possibly in a more stringent form than the House version.
There is less chance of completed action on product safety
legislation, although a House Interstate and Foreign Commerce
Subcommittee is currently conducting hearings on H.R. 8110, a
product safety bill.
In the labor area, the first order of business is Senate
consideration of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
Floor debate began on January 19 and
action was expected to be completed by the end of the month.
A House measure concerning this subject passed that body in
September.
In that version, H.R. 9247, EEOC would have to
request court action to enforce "cease-and-desist" orders.
Under the Senate bill, as reported by the Senate Labor and
Public Welfare Committee, EEOC would have "cease-and-desist"
powers.
Minimum wage 1 egisi ation is likely to be enacted this
session.
H.R. 7130, reported by the House Education and Labor
Committee in November, would boost the minimum wage to $2 an
hour.
The Senate Labor Subcommittee has under consideration
S. 1861 which would raise the minimum wage to $2 an hour the
year of enactment, and $2.25 one year later.

Emergency strike legislation is a hot issue due to the West
Coast dock strike.
On January 21 . President Nixon submitted a
message to the Congress requesting legislation to halt it, and
a bill was introduced by Senators Bob Packwood (R.-Ore.) and
Jacob Javits (R.-N.Y.) as Senate Joint Resolution 187.
The
full Senate Labor Committee began hearings on January 27 and
was expected to complete consideration of the proposal within
a week.
The measure would provide for the appointment of a 3-man
Arbitration Board to hear and settle the issues.
No strike or
lockout would be permitted from the date the legislation was
enacted until the day the Arbitration Board makes its deter­
mination.
The Board's determination would be made within 40
days and would be binding on all parties for 18 months.
The President also requested enactment of the emergency Public
Interest Protection Act of 1971 (S. 560 and H.R. 3596), which
would provide permanent authority to settle strikes in the trans­
portation industry.
f
While limited legislation to stop the West Coast dock strike
may be passed, it will be extremely difficult to get permanent
anti-strike legislation through in an election year.
Trade legislation was significantly omitted from the President's
State of the Union message.
It appears the Administration omitted
the issue in order to avoid providing a forum for consideration of
the Hartke-Burke bill or. other protectionist or restrictive trade
proposals.
In view of the broad scope of the Hartke-Burke measure
(S. 2592/H.R. 10914), it is receiving the attention of several MCA
committees--Economic Policy Review, Tax Policy, International
Trade and Government Relations.
The latter committee held a meet­
ing on January 27 to discuss the various courses of action which
might be taken by MCA should this proposal come up for congression­
al hearings.
Also, the Senate Commerce Committee has under consideration
the Export Expansion Act of 1971, S. 2754, on which the Adminis­
tration has not expressed a position.
Public hearings were
held by the Committee's Subcommittee on Foreign Commerce and
Tourism during the week of January 24.
More are scheduled later
in February.
Our International Trade Committee recommends that
written\testimony be submitted.
A proposed draft is in preparatior.o#hich will echo positions we have previously taken with
regard to expanding exports.
THE ECONOMIC POLICY REVIEW COMMITTEE...
CMA036163
...which you recently established, held its first meeting on
January 18 and considered matters relating to Phase II economic
policy and to the economic incentives for research and development
proposed by President Nixon in his State of the Union message.
The committee is chaired by William S. Sneath, President of
Union Carbide Corporation.
David C. Williams is serving as MCA
Staff Secretary.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA).. .
...will conduct hearings on proposed emission standards
concerning mercury, asbestos and beryllium as hazardous air
pollutants as follows:
New York, New York
January 18
Kansas City, Missouri
February 1
Los Angeles, California
February 15
In accordance with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970,
EPA's Administrator:
Is authorized to set emission standards for existing sources
of air contaminants which he finds to be hazardous, and
Can delay construction of a new emissions source for such
air pollutants until he first determines that the new source,,
if properly operated, will not violate his standards.
MCA is not participating in the above hearings.
However,
several member companies which produce chlorine and caustic by
the mercury cell process are active through the Chlorine
Institute.
Last December 23, standards of performance for atmospheric
-emissions from new or substantially modified sulfuric and nitric
acid plants were promulgated by EPA, together with those for
fixed steam generators, Portland cement plants, and municipaltype incinerators.
We submitted carefully documented comments
on the proposed standards following their publication last
August 17.
However, the final version took little cognizance
of the economic and technological factors we presented.
As a result, nine sulfuric acid producers, representing ap­
proximately 60% of the industry's production capacity, have
joined to seek judicial review of the standards for sulfuric
acid plants.
MCA is not involved.
EPA has announced its intention to propose Federal standards
of performance for atmospheric emissions from petrochemical
processes at an early date, and has invited the Association to
nominate industry representatives to an informal advisory grouD
to supplement the technical expertise of the EPA staff.
In
spite of limited success in previous efforts, we feel we should
continue to cooperate, and we thank our members for volunteering
their experts to serve on such advisory bodies.
EPA is soon expected to publish proposed regulations govern­
ing control of hazardous substances in relation to water quality
control, which have long been in preparation.
We are seeking an
opportunity for our technical specialists to cooperate in pre­
publication review of the proposal.

CHEMTREC...
...the Chemical Emergency Transportation Center, has received
over 2000 inbound call's since its inception September 5, 1971.
Some 200 calls concerned incidents involving chemicals in transit.
Many were made simply to confirm CHEMTREC's existence.
A signi­
ficant but dwindling number of calls resulted from the telephone
company having assigned CHEMTREC the discontinued reservation
number of the Howard Johnson motel chain.
Assistance has been provided in situations ranging from major
train derailments to leaks in small packages.
Tank cars and
drums have been the containers involved in about two-thirds of
the incidents reported.
Two problems involving ships in storms
in the Pacific Ocean have been successfully handled and one call
was from Alaska.
During CHEMTREC planning, it was anticipated that calls from
emergency services (fire, police) would predominate.
So far,
however, carriers are far ahead in making use of the service.
Hopefully, this will dispose of many problems before they need
emergency attention. •
Operating experience to date confirms the validity of the
chosen approach -- providing immediate information from file;
then utilizing the expertise of shippers.
f
Reaction to CHEMTREC has been good from carriers and emer­
gency services alike.
Prompt company follow-up has been an im­
portant factor in this achievement and cooperation by member
companies generally as well as many non-members has been excel­
lent.
During the week of March 6, several workshops on CHEMTREC
will be conducted by its Manager, John C-. Zercher, in Los Angeles,
San Francisco, Portland and Seattle.
Target audiences are: fire,
police and other emergency personnel plus non-member chemical
companies.
West Coast assistance is by the Southern California
Chemical Manufacturers Association and the Chemical Industry
Councils of Northern California and the Pacific Northwest.
PHTHALATES...
...particularly phthalate esters used as plasticizers for
plastics, mainly polyvinyl chloride, have been the subject of
f--a number of news items over the past year calling attention
‘to potential health and ecological consequences from their
widespread use.
1
As yet there have been no allegations of harm to human health.
However, researchers are concerned about finding these substances
in the heart muscle of various animals, extraction by the blood
in hospital containers and effects observed in experimental
animals.

As a result, one of our member companies suggested a con­
ference among technical representatives of interested companies,
to discuss reported findings and consider collective action. A
meeting for this purpose is scheduled at MCA headquarters on
February 24.

EXHIBIT A
STAFF PROPOSAL
concerning
Air Quality Committee Membership
of
Donald C. Winson
On February 10, 1970, at the request of the Air
Quality Committee, the Board of Directors approved
regularization of the membership of Donald C. winson
on this committee.
Mr. Winson, an outside counsel
representing Alcoa, was recognized as a valid exception to the "General Principles Applicable to the
Structure and Operations of Committees" provision
that membership be restricted to full-time employees
of member companies.
This action was made subject
to annual staff review and Board reconfirmation, and
on February 9, 1971, such reconfirmation was granted
by the Board.
As the factors leading to the earlier request
remain equally valid, the staff recommends the Board
approve Mr. Winson's continuation as a member of the
Air Quality Committee, subject to staff review and
Board reconfirmation at the end of another year.
Staff Proposal of February 10,
1970, is attached
for information.

STAFF PROPOSAL
concerning
Air Quality Committee Membership
of
Donald C. Winson
Frank L. Seamans, outside counsel of the Aluminum Company
of America, was on the charter roster of the Air Quality Committee
when it was organized in 1949, and was an outstanding contributor
to its program in the early years. Upon adoption of the "General
Principles Applicable to the Structure and Operations of Committees"
in 1963, on his own initiative he inquired whether the requirement
of "member-company full-time employee" for committee membership
would affect his status. General Hull, then MCA president, rul d
that this pre-existing menibership could continue undisturbed.
In 1964, Alcoa nominated Donald Cl Winson, a member of Mr.
Seamans' legal firm, as successor to Mr. Seamans. The record of
Board approval indicates only that Mr. Winson represents Alcoa,
with no evidence of recognition that he was not an Alcoa employee.
The irregularity of his membership was brought out in a recent
general review of committees by Staff Counsel.
The Air Quality Committee is eager for Mr. Winson to con­
tinue in full participation. His background of legal specializa­
tion in industrial air pollution is comparatively rare, and his
leadership at this juncture is especially valuable. He has been,
and is personally interested in continuing to be, an active con­
tributor to the Committee's needs. He can be particularly helpful
in the organization and development of the recently authorized
Joint Subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution Legislation and
Regulations.
Accordingly, primarily as a "grandfather" case and as such
not otherwise setting a precedent, and secondarily in recognition
of continuing need by the Committee for the services he is pecu­
liarly able to render, the staff recommends that the Board of
Directors regularize the membership of Donald C. Winson on the
Air Quality Committee as an acknowledged exception to the membercompany full-time employee qualification, subject to staff review
and Board reconfirmation annually.
