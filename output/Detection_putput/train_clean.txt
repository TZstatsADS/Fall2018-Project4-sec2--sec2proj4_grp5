exhibit dreport to the board of directorsmanufacturing chemists associationbailey barton chairmanair quality committeeapril it is a pleasure to be here today to report on the air qualitycommittees activitiessince my last presentation in february we have i believe made some substantial contributions tothe interests of the manufacturing chemists associationi would be remiss however if i characterized our effortsas being successful in meeting our objectivesyou may recall thati described  as the year of opportunity for amending the cleanair act in a positive wayit is true that the activity of congressin clean air legislation served to restrain the fervor of the epa inenforcing  deadlines of the clean alp actas did a few courtcasesbut the legislation actually emerging from congressional committees offers precious little prospect of making the act more reasonableit appears in fact that our environmentalist friends alsosaw  as a year of opportunity and seized the initiative in influencing even more stringent provisions than previously existedindustry may for example petition extension from the previous deadlines but must meet rigid criteria waive some of its rights and beprepared to either post performance bonds or actually pay penaltiesfor the delaymost critical however are the provisions of bothhouse and senate defining antidegradation or significant deterioration in arbitrary numerical or percentage termsthese provisions coupled with another planning process cannot avoid asubstantial and inevitable confrontation with industrial growth anddevelopmentundoubtedly you are already aware of these and other extrapolations of these amendments so i wont belabor the issuesourcommittee prepared and mca submitted several commentaries andposition papers to congress on these amendmentsas have many tradeassociationssome concessions have been obtainedbut the onlypositive report i can make today is that these amendments are notyet lawuntil they become so i pledge the air quality committscontinued diligence in attempting to bring about constructive legislationcma lwe have also been very active in environmental protection ag ncyr gulatory proceedingsthe two areas which were cited last year arestill the hot onesepa with one notable exception has elected to jemploy section iii to regulate emissions of substances which the admin istrator may reasonably believe constitute a hazardthe exceptionof course is the agencys choice of section the imminent hazardprovisionto propose vinyl chloride monomer limitationsthe agencyhas found that regulation of such emissions as sulfuric acid mist using section iii requires far leas substantiation than a new ambient airquality standardmoreover epa prefers the equipment efficiencyapproachbest practicable treatment if you willfthich this sectionprovideswe believe our committees careful scrutiny of these regulations and the propensity of individual company members to litigatethe issues they challenge have served to reduce the rate of promulgation of such regulationswe expect to continue following agency actionfrom inception to promulgation on the multitude of materials waitingin this way we believe mca member compa nies will profit by both technical input and uptodate communicationof impending problemsthe second area i mentioned last year has a special significancethe hydrocarbonphotochemical oxidant issueembryonic last februaryhas reached full flower as a published policy of epayou may r callthat the agency has concluded that all hydrocarbon emissions are ultimately oxidantor smogforming compounds and must be controlledthey are pressuring the states to tightenup hydrocarbon emission limits in the hypothetical hope of meeting ambient air oxidant standardsthis is being manifest in storage tank vapor controlrequirementsrevision of the former rule  photochemicallyreactive compoundlimits to reflect broader volatile organic and generally in thetransportation control strategy approachmajor impact of this shift in epa policy is being felt by ourindustry in the state of texas where hydrocarbon controls are beingthrust upon them by epas infamous region viin an effort to headoff the potentially large expenditures thus required the mcaaffiliate texas chemical council has requested our assistancelocallyth y have been joined by the

werepresented to the full air quality committee in january  inhouston texaswhere we had shifted our meeting for the purposeour committee sought out portions of the tcc program in which wecould best serve all member companieswe are preparing endeavorsto obtain emission control cost data from member companies anddefinitive information on hydrocarbonoxidant relationships inseveral citiesspecific proposals for board authorization offunding should be completed shortly and in our view they represent substantive support to the texas chemical councils requestfor helpthis is also a primary result of our committees ratherdifficult task of negotiating a veritable maze of alternativeapproaches to this very complex questionin a related development epa has invited mca aqc participation in a reactivitytask group which we expect will provide another avenue to exploring the uncertainties of supporting data in the near futurei am aware that it has been over a year since i told you that was a reasonable sum to budget for this effortand i amgrateful that you chose to budget halfthat  even thoughwe have not until now offered a specific recommendation for itsexpenditurethe data base which supports epas contentions hasso many uncertainties that we have deemed it necessary to explorenumerous possible avenues before focusing on the one which webelieve to be most productive in terms of value received for moneyspenti appreciate your patience in this matter and believe thatour committees deliberations since tccs first request in novemberwill reward their patience as welli wont belabor the other committee and intercommittee activities which are underwaythe foregoing have occupied most of the aqcs recent attention and areexemplaryturning to another area of committee activityone to whichthe board responded to a concern expressed by all environmentalcommittee officers last yearwe very much appreciate the guidanceoffered by dr taufens committee in resolving mca staff and technical committee relationship problemsclair mr anderson and dr barnes were very sensitive to thecma questions and comments which arose in our several sessions andencouraged initiation of communications sessions which have takenus far down the road of enlightenmentthis i hope will continuesince it serves both the committees and the mca staffand ultimately the membership of mcaadditionally i would personallyrecommend periodic detailed review by a board committee to insureexpeditious resolution of staffcomnittee conflictsi must mention two remaining problem areas which i view aschronicfirst the delicate statutory and regulatory aspects ofour work requireindeed they demanda unique technicallegalpartnership to maximize effectivenesswe engineers tend to overlook legal subtleties in calculating the true effects of governmental proposals so we need to rehearse our thoughts in concert withdetailminded working lawyersthe legal advisory committee hasaddressed this issue and has offered constructive recommendationshowever translation of the abstract into the concrete has beendifficult to consummatethe air quality committee could be moreeffective if we had a participating attorney in our meetings andstatutoryregulatory reviewsi bring another unresolvedor perhaps i should say temporarily resolvedproblem to your attention today because i viewit as a chronic and strengthsapping enigmafor most of  wehad four nominees and no place for themthe bylaws say for usto rotate off members when this situation existsbut every plan offered was rejected by the full committeefinally the officerschose in the face of indignation rebuke and even a threatenedlawsuit to rotate off four lax attendees and seat the nomineesbut much valuable meeting time had been lost in the debateinmy view our recent solution will only last until the next nomineecomes alongi will close my oral remarks by looking ahead to future endeavorsfor a few momentsi see the air quality committees attention phasingfrom the old nuts and bolts control aspect into the more exotichealth effects arenathis will require a broader much more sophisticated data base and perhaps more health oriented personnel to makemeaningful contributions to association interestsi also envisiona committeestaff necessity to do much more extensive image buildingor more properlyimage repairing to counter the chemicals

ina new bureaucracy formerly called businesstotal successiicma exhibit ereport to the board of directorsmanufacturing chemists associationdennis p bridge chairmansolid wastes management committeeapril  the primary solid wastes management committee swmc concernis for legislative proposals for socalled hazardous wastematerialsfor the last several years the swmc reports haveindicated legislative activity during the previous year and theexpectation of restrictive legislation the following year although i am pleased to say that these forebodings have not cometo pass i quickly note that the current situation is quitesimilar to that of past years  legislation may well be passedduring this election yearthe first significant act dealingwith solid waste was passed in  and the second legislativeaction followed in during  there was legislativeactivity in this area and assuming five years to be a reasonablegestation period  could be the yearthis legislation willnot be as far reaching as that being proposed for toxic substancesbut it will significantly impact chemical process industry cpioperationssince the last swmc report to the board there have beennine major legislative proposals either actual bills or workingdrafts concerning solid wasteof these the senate public workscommittee bill s  sponsored by senator jennings randolphand the house interstate and foreign commerce committee subcommittee on transportation and commerce working draft as sponsoredby congressman rooney are the two most likely candidates forenactmentthe administration has not sponsored a bill but hasindicated general support of s  we expect that eachproposal will reach its respective floor in mayalthough with some undesirable provisions senator randolphsbill is certainly the more acceptable of the two proposalsbothdocuments contain hazardous waste sections but s  is muchless complicated and it does not require federal approval for allpermits for waste transport treatment and storage but ratherconcentrates on state implementation of a permit system similarto current air and water requirementsthe rooney proposalrequires permits at both levelsin addition it addresses severalcma iiiareas not included in s  such as product and container controlas a means of source waste reduction and tax incentives for recycling we believe that the rooney working draft will be modifiedto resemble the senate public works proposalwhatever the final form of the legislation mca will stronglyespouse the concept of performance requirements for waste disposalrather than the predetermination or specification approach currentlybeing fostered waste should be deemed hazardous only after itstoxicity quantity and disposal site have been carefully consideredpredetermination of a waste disposal method without investigatingeach of these parameters is counterproductive because this restrictsdevelopment of new technology and precludes the use of viablealternatives appropriate to specific geographical areas or toavailable equipment mca will contend that the authority overthe areas of packaging transportation and storage of wastematerials continue to be vested in the us department of transportationshould adoption of a permit system be unavoidablewe will advocate that the disposal site rather than the generatorbe the permittee and that state implementation of the permitsystem under federal guidelines is preferred over direct federalinterventionfinally to provide for reasonable regulatoryrequirements from both a technical and economic viewpoint wewill strive for sufficient time constraints and flexibility inany legislation to accommodate the dearth of technology and disposal cost data currently available to usmany of the states most notably texas and california have passed solid waste management legislation dealing with hazardouswastesbecause this legislation has preceded federal hazardouswaste disposal activity it is quite likely that the epa mayadopt those concepts fostered by these states which have provento be most workableswmc monitors bellwether states forconcepts which might be incorporated into federal regulationsin addition liaison is being maintained with the national solidwaste management association nswma to monitor its efforts todevelop a legislative guide for use by each stateaiswmc legislative activity is directed almost solely todisposal of hazardous wasteschemical packaging has not beenraised as an issue to dateshould this occur swmc will ask thechemical packaging committees assistance on this matter whichis of vital importance to the cpi from a marketing as well asdisposal viewpointtlcma a secondary but very important swmc concern is meaningfulliaison with the epasolid waste control is unique among environmental concerns because the epa has had a relatively long leadtime to perform research and gather data to establish regulationson a more scientific basis while still complying with the stringenttime frame expected in the enabling legislationswmc feels it important especially in view of epas intentto present mca positions at every opportunityduring the pastyear there have been three salient examples of swmc work with epafirst during our may   meeting epas officeof solid waste management programs oswmp representativesmade a presentation on an epa  million landfill projectbeing conducted with the state of minnesotathis projectis intended to determine the effectiveness of modern landfill design and operational techniquesseveral membercompanies are following this work closelysecond ondecember   at one of four epa public meetings onhazardous waste the chairman of swmc presented comprehensivetestimony on behalf of mca in response to a formal eparequest for such informationthe epa is now developingsynopses of the various comments as a basis for its positionon legislation and on subsequent regulationsfinally ameeting was held with personnel from the epas solid andhazardous waste research division municipal environmentalresearch laboratory in cincinnati ohio in conjunction witha regular swmc meetingswmc members have repeatedlyexpressed a desire to investigate the possibilities ofcontracting research work to fill existing data gaps in thearea of landfill disposal of potentially hazardous wastesto avoid duplication it is important that we ascertain thescope of epa research activities the epa presentation andsuggestions were well received and very beneficial inguiding us toward an appropriate research activity to beidentified by our technical subcommitteea compendium of  successful case histories of wasterecycling or residua disposal is being developed by the technicalsubcommittee this document will provide positive cpi input tovarious legislative and regulatory proposals with respect to thesignificant amount of current work within industry on disposal ofpotentially hazardous wastesa joint subcommittee composed of representatives of theswmc and water resources committee was formed in  to developguidelines for deepwell disposalthis document has just beenpublishedcma the concept of land use regulation continues to disturbswmc members and representatives of the other environmentalcommitteesland use legislation could be the most insidioustool available to those who would punitively regulate the cpiforms of land use regulation are currently embodied in federalair water and coastal zone management legislation and severalland use proposals have been made relative to solid waste disposal as a result of the total environmertal implications ofthis issue the task group on land use consisting of two representatives from each of the three environmental committees wasestablished at the swmcs requestthe group is to review thequestion of land use with respect to possible implications oncpi operations and to make appropriate recommendations to themca board for actionduring its organizational meeting thegroup concluded that prior to developing recommendations formca board action there is a definite need to ascertain currentcpi status with respect to all existing federal and regionalland use legislationbecause of the legal nature of the activitymca staff through the joint subcommittee on environmental lawjsel or other legal source has been formally requested todevelop this information for the task group by july  the task group will then develop its recommendations to mcaby september the question of jsel continuation under review by thelegal advisory committee for some time has reportedly beenresolved in that jsel will remain intact and function in amanner yet to be defined we have been assured by mca staffthat legal assistance will be available upon requestatpresent at least two formal requests have been made to jsel byswmc seeking legal assistancethese include upcoming proposalson solid waste legislation and the land use issuein order toproperly address these important issues it is imperative thatlegal as well as technical expertise be readily availabletodate in keeping with past jsel performance we have not receivedindication that consideration of our requests has been initiatedif we are to effectively influence and combat unacceptable legislative proposals adequate legal assistance is a mustwith the exception of the jsel question some progress hasbeen made in improving internal mca communications and organizational difficulties which were highlighted in the previoustwo swmc reports as per recommendations of the ad hoc committeeon environmental affairs two meetings have been held betweenenvironmental committee chairmen and various mca staff to discussmca administrative procedures and methods by which mca can actin a more unified and timely fashionas a result of thesemeetings several measures have been recommended to fosterimprovementone of these provides for government relationsdepartment input into environmental committee meetings on acontinuing basisa member of the government relations staffhas been assigned to work with swmc in liaison capacitythisin addition to the consistent and competent efforts of ourcurrent staff secretary should be beneficial to swmc activitiesto insure that a continuing dialogue is maintained amongall facets of mca environmental affairs i recommend that ameeting of environmental committee members and appropriate mcastaff be held annually to provide a forum for exchange andcoordination of information from all relevant sources reviewof mca administration procedures and resolution of issuesinvolving more than one of the environmental committeesin conclusion swmc is concerned with the ultimate disposalof potentially hazardous wastesof all the areas of environmental control ultimate disposal most readily reflects the needfor a total environmental control approach we may see significant successes in air and water pollution abatement processesbut what has the cpi really accomplished if these successes are negated because we are unable to dispose of the abatement processresidues or other potentially hazardous wastes in a technicallyand economically feasible manner we believe that if the legalgovernmental and technical expertise which should be availableto us through mca auspices can be combined into timely actionwe need not be the weak link in the chain of total environmentalcontroldennis p bridge chairmancma exhibit ereport by the director of government relationswilliam mstovermay  senate committee working on tax legislationthe senate finance committee began markup of tax reformtaxreduction legislation on april  and is expected to report sometype of tax measure by midjune although it is not clear justwhat the scope of the committees action will be it is entirely possible that their bill will simply extend tax reduction provisions which expire on june  thus delaying action on a taxreform package until later in the year senator russell longchairman of the finance conxnittee has indicated that such acourse is a distinct possibilityduring the past two weeks of markup sessions the senatecommittee dealt primarily with tax shelters of little directinterest to the chemical industryit is significant to notehowever that most decisions could be characterized as easingoff on limitations or restrictions included in the housepassedtax reform bill hr  many observers are concludingtherefore that when the conmictee takes up capital formationand foreign income provisions its actions will be generallymore favorable to industry than chat of the househowever there is still danger ahead whenever a tax billcomes up for senate floor action  be it a simple extension ofexpiring tax reduction provisions or a comprehensive tax reformtax reduction package  senator kennedy and several other reformminded senators are expected to introduce a number of antibusinessamendments these are likely to include proposals to repeal deferral of taxation of income of foreign subsidiaries restrictthe use of the foreign tax credit eliminate disc entirely repealthe asset depreciation range adr system and repeal the percentage depletion allowance for hard mineralscma the fate of these extreme amendments will depend on theability of the business community to convince a majority ofsenators of the damaging impact of the proposals on u sbusiness and the general economythis was emphasized yesterday by u s senator herman etalmadge of georgia secondranking democrat on the senatefinance committeein addressing mcas chemical forum he urgedcompany officials to communicate their views on tax changes toall senators and especially to those on the finance committeein order to stimulate savings and capital investment senatortalmadge indicated that he favored proposals recommended by theadministration and supported by mca to make the  investmenttax credit permanent to reduce the corporate tax rate eliminatedouble taxation of corporate profits and to modify the presentmethod of taxing capital gains he fully supports retention ofthe foreign tax credit and disc and firmly opposes any changesthat would materially alter and burden the competitive positionof our companies operating abroadit is his opinion that manymembers of the finance committee shared his views on these mattersvarious business organizations are urging industry spokesmento contact all senators with whom they have constituent relationsto make known their views on these issues we certainly supportthis line of action and believe that such contacts should bemade before june clean air amendments hit snag in senatethe public works committees of both the house and senate havereported bills in what is the first attempt at comprehensive revision of the clean air act of  pl an emotional struggle is under way over provisions containedin both bills intended to protect clean air against significantdeteriorationboth bills establish certain mandatory class iareas where only small amounts of additional pollution would beallowed the committees say their nondeterioration proposalswould give states more control over the

anamendment proposed by senator frank moss d utahthe democraticleadership has recently postponed until early june the floor debate on senator muskies bill sthe moss amendment woulddefer the new nondeterioration restrictions for one year duringthat period a national commission on air quality established inthe senate bill studies the economic and energy impacts of theproposal and considers whether the government has enough technicalinformation to implement itby late april senator moss had gathered  cosponsors six republicans and six democrats the hasty decision to postponefloor action is being interpreted as an indication that his proposal now has the backing to be adopted and that opponents needmore time to solidify their opposition mca is therefore continuing to work to build

committeemay it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to report to youon the activities of the fdcc committee and to share with youthoughts that have grown out of my association with the work ofthe committee during the past yearas you know the objectives and the function of the fdcccommittee are as followsto advise thp board of directors concerningchemicals used in foods drugs and cosmetics and inaccord with association policies and proceduresdevelop positions on legislation and regulations affecting such chemicals formulate principles and encouragetechnical development pertinent to their use andcooperate with other organizations having parallelinterestsconsidering the rapid rate of developments in the past fewyears these responsibilities represent no small taskthe activitiesof the committee during the past year have been directed largelytoward consolidating and implementing organizational improvementsinitiated during the preceding yearthe organizational structurethat has been established consists essentially of a legislative andregulatory subcommittee a scientific subcommittee and a communications subcommittee which are designed to closely follow developments in their respective areasthe subcommittees through theirrespective chairmen and the steering subcommittee function bydeveloping and referring welldeveloped reports and proposals tothe full committee for review and actionthis structural concepttakes advantage of the available manpower by establishing a welldefined division of the work areas eliminating repetitious meetingsand concentrating on developing concrete proposals for the basisof committee actiontask force units with specific areas of assignment within these broad lines of division have also been used toadvantagecma during the past year for example the committee preparedand submitted extensive comments on the fda proposed administrativepractices and procedures regulationsof particular importance tomca was the fda position stated in section  b of these proposedregulations that any representation made by a trade associationshall be on behalf of its members and shall constitute a representation on behalf of each member of the trade association exceptthose specifically excluded by name in any such submissiontheobstacles to equitable administration of justice under the lawthat could be evoked by such a provision are so numerous as to precludedetailed reference in this reportsuch objections have been fullydocumented in our submission to fdaother features of the proposedregulations to which we have submitted substantial comments haveincluded a proposed limitation on the opportunity to present oraltestimony and to crossexamine witnesses during hearings and theestablishment of criteria which the fda asserted constituted aproper basis on which to deny a petition or right to a hearingthese provisions and others of varying degrees of importance andimpact are not merely a codification of existing fda procedures butin many respects represent a basic change in practices that restrictthe rights of individuals subject to the agencys jurisdiction toobtain consideration and reviewanother legislative development of importance which is nowunder review by the legislative and regulatory subcommittee is thekennedy food surveillance bill salthough originally heraldedas applying primarily to food manufacturing and processing establishments this proposed legislation has implications extending beyondthese areasunder the manufacturing sections surveillance featuresare included relating to the establishment of safety assurance procedures within plants product coding record keeping and inspectionsin addition the bill contains provisions for requiring registrationof food establishmentshowever in a broader context the billimposes obligations on food processors to immediately notify theinstitution of a recall as well as the possibility that processedfoods may be adulteratedcitizens civil actions also are authorrized under the billadditionally the bill contains extensivenew requirements pertaining to the label identification of allingredientsin addition to these activities the committee has alsomonitored the nci carcinogenic bioassay program the fcc and faowhomonographs for food chemicals and the fda review of gras substancescma these activities have been carried out primarily under the programof the scientific subcommittee together with a number of otherprojects relating to technical developments in the area of fooddrug and cosmetic chemicalsthe development of proposed goodmanufacturing practices guidelines for bulk drugs and food chemicalsis presently under study by this subcommitteein addition technicalliaison is carried out with the activities of pma as they relateto bulk drugs and with gma as they relate to food chemicalsa project presently active within the communications subcommittee is the development of a proposal for the formation of achemical industry information centeralthough the details of theorganization and operation of such a center and various considerationsrelating to its establishment are not yet defined in concrete termsit is believed that such a center could help to improve the publicsunderstanding of questions and controversies that confront ourindustrywhile the above describe briefly the broad spectrum of activties that have been carried forward during the past year a summaryof the committees activities would not be complete without anappropriate evaluation of this work as it relates to the objectives of the committees responsibilities to mcasuch objectives clearlymust be understood in the light of the legislative and regulatoryclimate that exists todayseen in this perspective one can onlyfeel a keen sense of inadequacy  of constantly striving to barelykeep up with developments and the frustration of being able only tosuperficially react to the various problems that continue to arisedespite the diligent efforts of restructuring the fdcccommittee it is believed that a more fundamental reevaluation ofthe mca activity in this area should be undertakencourse a variety of ways in which response to the greater burdenin this area of our activities can be madei would not propose aspart of this brief report to attempt to define in detail any particular solutionit is appropriate however to recognize that thetime may have arrived whep the means which have served us well inthe past are no longer adequate to serve industries needs in thearea of food drug and cosmetic chemicalsmca has always prided itself on the fact that committee leadership and most of the working input comes from the member companiesi suggest that this policy may no longer be appropriate in areas ofcma fliproliferating legislation and regulation such as food drug andcosmetic lawthese regulations are targeted at many areasfrequently beyond the scope of interest of any single member companytherefore i urge this board to appoint a committee to study theissue of from where should the leadership of any particular committeecomeshould it be from the mca staff or should it continue tocome from the member companiesthe conclusion may not be the samefor all committeesnevertheless x think this situation shouldbe given a fresh lookifcma exhibit greport to the board of directorsmanufacturing chemists associationgeorge a coffenberg chairmantransportation and distribution committeemay  in ray initial report for the transportation and distribution committeeon april  of last year i restricted my comments to two items of major significance having future impact on the chemical industry a more detailedreport on the committees activities was appended to my remarks today myoral report will focus on three topics and i refer you to the filed reportfor the balancethe chemical industry owns or operates approximately  tank carsand is compensated by the railroads through a mileage allowance of from to  per loaded car mile depending on the value of the car the railroads pay an allowance to suppliers of private rail cars in that freight ratestake into consideration a cost to the railroads of supplying cars prior to the allowance per mile was a onelevel allowance a car owner or operator was paid the same rate per mile irrespective of whether a car had a valuethe chemical industry having the newer and higher valued cars was ofthe opinion that the compensation paid by the railroads should recognize thedifference of investment in the cars and pay a higher allowance to the morevaluable cars than paid to cars of lower value after long negotiations atrilevel system of compensation was established in november  howeverbecause of disagreement among the railroads as to how the system was to w rkthe matter was contested before the interstate commerce commission icc withthe car suppliers on one side and the railroads on the othercoomienclng in  through may of this year three major car compensation cases have been adjudicated before the icc in  after a fav rableicc decision to an mca complaint the threelevel system of compensation established in  was changed to a sixlevel system however the rates ofcompensation to be paid by the railroads were frozen to car values establishedin  the final case icc docket  instituted by mca over four yearsago is about to be discontinued as a result of an interim agreement negotiated between the litigants the negotiations followed a favorable decision bydivision  for mca mcas complaint was supported by the american petroleum institute the corn refiners association the institute of shortening andedible oils the major tank car leasing companies and allied chemical corp rationthe interim agreement accomplishes the following the mileage rate for all six levels of compensation wasto be increased on thirty days notice by  thisincrease became effective may   tank car compensation had not been increased since january   itis estlmatad that the increase annualized will return tothe tank car perators an additional  million thechemical industrys share is estimated at  millioncma sine  the railroads only adjusted tank car compensation upward afcer adjudication of a complaint beforethe icc the agreement provides chat tank car compensation will be adjusted in relation to and at the time therailroads adjust the compensation paid one another foruse of each others cars the railroads have increasedthe compensation paid to each ocher four times aggregating  since the last time tank car compensation wasincreased we expecc the new rates of compensationeffective may i will again be increased in the firstquarter of  when the railroads increase car compensation to each othernew tank cars entering the rail fleet frozen at valuations for the purpose of compensation will nowenter the fleet at their fair market value for examplea car valued in  dollars at  will call for amileage race of  per loaded mile whereas prior tothis agreement such cars would have been adjusted by aformula to a value of  and compensated at a rateof  existing cars will be reevaluated and if thefair markec value of the car places it in a higher mileage group the car will be reassigned to the higher grouptank car owners and operators will support the establishment of an equalization rule whereby the railroads willbe compensated for excess empty miles when empty milesexceed loaded miles by more than the icc will issue an order commencing a rule makingproceeding for the purpose of establishing rules andmethods for determining cank car compensation in thefuture when completed the icc will issue another order canceling the interim agreement and prescribing thebasis on which tank car compensation is to be paid andthe mechanisms for its implementation rule making maytake as long as three years to completein summary we not only see the light at the end of the tunnel but wecan see the end of the tunnel during che next three years complex anddifficult negotiating will be carried out with the railroads under icc supervision mcas objective will be to do its best to assure that the rulesfinally prescribed will provide equitable compensation for those who supplytank carslast report dealt at length with public law  the federal waterpollution control act and in particular the  amendments covering spillsof hazardous polluting substances and the civil penalties provided for suchspills in section  i advised that an ad hoc interindustry committeeincluding mca was seeking legislative relief from the punitive provisions ofthis section hr  was introduced september   to amend severalsections of the law and section  of the bill while not totally to the liking of the ad hoc committee would have been a vast improvement from theexisting law mca testified in support of the bill with caveats as to thecma meaning intended by certain language in the bill mca offered to work withthe environmental protection agency epa on the development of guidelines tocarry out the intent of cne dubious language along the lines of mcas testimony epa administrator russell train testified in support of hr including support of section  the desired revisions in the law as encompassed in section  were recommended by the house public works subcommittee handling the billhowever in markup before the full house committee on public worksand transportation the penalty language in section  underwent a significantand unfortunate twist the bill provided for a maximum penalty of in markup to placate certain committee members who were seeking to preservethe maximum penalty of  when from a vessel and  when from ashorebased facility as provided in the  amendments the committee approved a threetier approach to penalties the amendment in effect providesa maximum penalty of  for a first spill a maximum of  for asecond spill and a maximum of  for spills in excess of two during athreeyear period the markup made no change in the language concerningspills involving willful negligence or willful misconducthr  is expected to obtain a rule from the rules committee for consideration by the house some time this month tt is the best judgment ofthose who are familiar with legislative procedures that the markup committeehas made such a christmas tree of the bill chat it stands a very goodchance of being voted down by the house if this does not occur becauses  the senates companion bill is so different than hr  an effort will be made to return the penalty language to its original form duringthe house and senate conference the fallback position will be to eliminatesection  in its entiretythe transportation of hazardous materials continues to receive adversepublicity far out of proportion to the safety its transportation record deserves the department of transportation dot through its director of theoffice of hazardous materials when testifying on the transportation safetyact of  estimated that there are over two billion tons of hazsrdousmaterials shipped annually with as many as  shipments tendered dailymajor accidents involving hazardous materials have been relatively few whenconsidering the exposure but each one raises new cries for increased regulationsince  the department of transportation has been attempting todevelop a new hazard information system integrating vehicle placards andshipping papers with the ability for a quick emergency response the dotsmost recent effort is an advance notice of rule making identified hazardousmaterials docket no  the xt requested that responses to the docketevaluate nine hazard information systems proposed by respondents in a pastdocket against nine criteria that a hazard information system should meetmcas response

ago introduced a billtitled the industrial reorganization act and last year reintroduced a slightly revised versionthe bill was intended tofacilitate the splitting of companies in a number of named industriesinto smaller units provided that certain arbitrary arithmeticalmeasures indicate the existence of economic concentration in thegiven industry the chemical industry was one of seven listed as apossible targetthis bill was formally abandoned by senator hart on may this year he conceded that its enactment was not politicallyfeasiblein the foreseeable future he then introduced a moremodest monopolization reform act s it would amend thesherman antitrust act in four respectsit would eliminate any requirement of proof of intentto monopolize in actions brought by the united statesit would eliminate superior performance as a defenseto actions brought by the united states it would eliminate the prima facie effect of a governmentjudgment in such an action for subsequent private tripledamagesit would allow courts to take into consideration economicsof scale in fashioning remediesno action is expected this year on this new hart bill andindeed in view of senator harts decision not to seek reelectionits future is dubiouswhen the hart industrial reorganization act was first introducedmca in order to be prepared for all contingencies engaged aneconomic consultant professor

deconcentration has been completed andis available while senator harts judiciary subcommittee on antitrust and monopoly did not in fact hold any hearings on the chemicalindustry the lustgarten report

conservation to the department of commerce andthe f deral energy administrationas of the preparation of thisreport the most recent energy conservation report was that submitt d in april  of this year in which  mca member companiesparticipatedthe report showed energy conservation for thecalendar year  as  per unit of output compared with as a base yearwithout the energy costs of osha and environmentalregulations in effect in  but not in  the energy conservation rate would have been an overriding reason for therelative modesty of these figures was that due to the recessionour industry was operating at only  of capacity in  compared with  in there are very few major mca member companies not taking partin mcas energy reporting program or those of other relevant associations such as the fertilizer institute and the pharmaceuticalmanufacturers associationthese few companies have been individuallycontacted and will hopefully be taking part in the next report tothe two federal agencies due in midseptemberthis voluntary program is the result ofan october meeting between top commerce department and fea officials and topofficials of some  major chemical companies all mca

energyconsuming industriesby twodigit sic codes officially identified early this yearnotsurprisingly our industry sic  ranks firstfor each of these top  industries fea is to set an energyconservation goal replacing the consensus goals under which manyindustries including ours have been operatingfea has contractedwith outside consultants to study each of the ten industries andpropose goals  which of course fea can accept or modifybecause of the complexity of the chemical industry feainitially had difficulty getting an appropriate contractor to takeon the jobhowever thanks in part to mcas interest in having aqualified contractor take on this responsibility battelle memorialinstitute finally undertook it with chem systems as subcontractorthe engineering and technical subcommittee of the energy conservationcommittee worked closely with the contractors aiding them individuallyand collectively in their demanding task and contributing their expertise in methodologythe contractors have submitted their reportand it will be published in the federal register in late septemberwith public hearings in octoberit is quite possible that consumer and environmental groups maytestify in opposition to any proposed reasonable target for ourindustry so mca must be prepared to testify in its own behalfinternal studies carried on by the committee indicate that the industry can meet a target in the neighborhood of in further conformity with epca requirements fea must identifythe top energyconsuming companies in each of the ten alreadyidentified industries  either the  highestranking companies orthose using over a trillion btus in energy per year whichevernumber is smallersome  companies reporting through mca havelisted energy purchases of over a trillion btus a year and theremay be other such companies reporting through the fertilizerinstitute etcit therefore seems likely that the cutoff pointfor chemical companies will be somewhat over a trillion btus percma runder epca provisions and regulations companies reportingthrough industry programs such as mcas may be exempted from individual reporting even if it would otherwise be required of themthe criteria for acceptable industry programs will be published inthe federal registerhowever because fea is falling behind itsepca timetable there remains a  chance that companies mayhave to file at least one mandatory individual report in early another section of epca provides for the encouragement andsubsidy of state energy programshere mcas prime interest is inexempting major industries like ours from reporting to the variousstates since they already report to federal agenciesif howeversome states insist upon industrial energy conservation reportingw would urge them to adopt the same

importance ofmatters that are now pending pertaining to international trade would like to quote from ambassador frederick dent of theoffice of special trade representative strthe occasion wasa plenary meeting in washington some two weeks ago for a groupof industry sector advisory committees or isac ambassadorpent told us that imports into this country in  are expected to be up  over those of  while exports will be uponly  the expected trade deficit will be approximatelyo billion dollarsimports of petroleum products in the usa were valued at  billion dollarsthis year they areexpected to reach  billion dollarsgentlemen the need for industry support in the internationaltrade area has never been as great as it is nowtoday in theunited states the cost of feedstock for the petrochemical industry is less than the corresponding cost in the common marketec but it is expected to be equal to that of the commonmarket in about four years your international trade committeesuggests that strong continued industry support on international trade is a musti am advised that the subject of trade did not appear in thetop  items which certain mca member companies agreed to bethose subjects of the greatest concern to them according to arecent surveyhowever it does appear that we could havelongrange problems in our economy unless international tradefor our country increases to offset these deficitswith this scenario in mind i would now like to give you anutline of what i hope to cover in the next  to  minutesfirst i plan to spend about  minutes on the status of thet negotiationsthe main part of my presentation to you last about  minutes and this is devoted to the workt is going on in isac chemicalsi would like to windup with a brief comment concerning ocita office of chemicalindustry trade advisor fcma min regard to gatt i am aware that dr dawson has pretty muchkept you up to date in this areathe written report of theseremarks that you will receive will give you the details of howthe tariff formula which was first tabled by the usa differs from the one that the common market brought out injulythe tariff formula tabled by the u s suggests that all tariffsabove  be cut by  the maximum allowed by the trade actand those below  by a formula of cuts between theec formula proposes tariffs would be cut by their own amount aprocess that would be repeated four timesthat is to say atariff of  would initially be cut b  the result being a tariffdoing this four more times would mean an ultimatetariff of the european version tends to embrace moreharmonization in that it cuts the higher duties more than ourformula doeswe remain critical of the ec proposal in that it specificallyexcludes agricultural productsthe common market still hopesto keep this delicate subject separate from other trade areasthe international trade committee shares the feeling that theec formula is not ambitious enough since it would result in anav rage reduction of the current duties of about  and thatis before any exceptions are taken into accounti understandthat mr ford during his visit to the summit meeting in puertorfco stated that the u s should shoot for a target cut of of the current tariffs of our ec trading partnerssincemr ford was referring to a cut after exceptions are taken intoaccount you can see this leaves a wide gap for our negotiatorsto closeas to the timing of the final decision on the tariff formulayou are aware that the swedes have recently settled their electionssoon it will be the west germans and the japanese atthe first of this coming year there will be a replacement ofeight of the nine ec ministers in brussels all of this coupled with our own elections in november leads your committeeto the conclusion that not only will there be an agreement onthe formula but also no serious negotiations will beginbefore early to mid at bestcma igovernment continues however to let us know that things areindeed busy in geneva with various multilateral trade negotiation mtn subgroups at work hammering out preliminary detailsthese subgroups have been meeting with our trading partners inan effort to come to a mutual understanding on how to treatsuch matters as subsidies countervailing duties access tosupply government procurement standards and codes gatt reform and the very important subject of nontariff barriersdue to a wide variety of nontariff barriers currently employed it is thought by many that the settlement of this matter ismore critical than the agreement upon a tariff formulaisacsix members of whom are from the mca international trade committee are providing u s chemical industry overviews on howwe wish these matters to be handled when negotiations do finallytake placethis leads me into the subject of how isac is progressing atour meeting some two weeks ago in washington we were told byrepr sentatives of the department of commerce as well as theoffice of special trade representative that isac was betterprepared and better organized than any of the remaining  isacsthis praise by the government is not meant to imply that we necessarily expect to do better in the negotiations than we did inthe kennedy round nor better than any of the other idustries ofthe united states but we do want you to know that we see noreason for government to eventually point the finger at our industry and tell us that we failed in doing our homeworkthere still remains an inadequate twoway flow of informationin these large and complex government private sector committeestructures at the same time it is agreed that they are functioning better than they were at the startstr continues totell us that they are determined to further improve the isacsystem and that the outcome of the negotiations will depend toa great extent on just how well we have prepared the genevanegotiators which in turn is saying just how well the isacfunctionedcma due to the complexity of the chemical industry we were forcedin isac to fragment into seven subcommittees which arebenzenoid intermediates pigments fertilizers pesticidesinorganics miscellaneous organics and dyestuffsthe fullisac committee is expected to meet four times this year whilethe subgroups will meet at least that many times at the present time we are hard at work trying to determine just whichchemical products would be most sensitive to tariff cutsthisis the exceptions listthere is one key area that i solicitthe help of those of you present today in this respect andthat is in the field of inorganic productsmore input intoour committee is definitely required by industry to be surethat correct decisions by isac members are being madethisinput as it pertains to sensitivity should be made directlyto the department of commerce and the appropriate address isgiven in the written report of these remarksindustry consultation policy staff department of commercewashington d cas isac works with this exceptions list and brings it to aconclusion we are informed by government that our next stepwill be one of being certain that we can ultimately provide thenecessary justification for our decisionsby utilization of achecklist we are preparing ourselves to address these questionsfrom government we are also establishing priorities within thexceptions list itselfthus the critical area for our industry will probably reside in the rules for determining exceptionand the ultimate ability of our negotiators to obtain exceptionsfor the import sensitive products whether it is on a multilateralor bilateral basisin addition to this work on exceptions we continue to pressgovernment for the conversion of our specific and compoundduties to an ad valorem basis the selection of the base yearbeing the critical mattersome base year has to be agreedupon in order to provide a starting point for the calculationof the value of the concessions to be negotiatedthis is moreimportant for the chemical industry than perhaps any other dueto the fact that we have such a large number of specific andcompound duties and to the sharp rises in the chemical pricesover the last several yearscma rfinally i wish to report that dr dawson in the capacity ofthe chemical industry trade advisor has reactivated thetechnical advisory committee we will have our first meetingtomorrow in new york citydr dawson has restructured thiscommittee and it is planned that this is yet another way thatoar industry can be sure of addressing all agencies of ourgovernment with uniform voicein addition to mca dcma socmaspx and various members of isac will all be brought togethertomorrow under one committeethis organization is not restricted as is the isac program in that twoway communication is possibleone item that was not included in my outline that may be of interest to you gentlemen deals with a recent survey sent tothe chemical industry by the stanford research institute sriin conjunction with the u s department of labordue to thedetail that the survey called for an overwhelming number ofu sbased chemical companies have declined to respondin conclusion within the next  months there is a reasonablechance that our negotiators will begin a serious dialogue withthere continues to be a serious need forcontinued industry input to insure we take advantage of allavailable opportunitieshaving been in the position of chairman of this committee only about four months now i am happy

pension payments to former federal employeeshave increased by nearly  of which  was occasioned by rise in theconsumer price indexit is proposed to increase pension payments by  per yearin retirement

timesannual salary but no continuation in retirement the option to convertat personal expense is unattractive because of the high cost of attainedagepremium continuation is not uncommon however but usually on a reduced and declining scaleit is proposed to provide term life insurance for members ofthe staff retiring from mca on or after december   as followsdesigned for family protection rather than as an estate factorfor any mca retiree who completed seven yearsof service of which at least five during the tenyer period immediately preceding retirementwere continuous and whohas legal

substitution of ordinary life for term life insurancethe cost of life insurance provided to an employee in excess of  coverage is supplemental income taxable to the employee at higher salarylevels the twotimessalary term life insurance benefit provided by mcaimposes a considerable tax outlayiks allows for a combination of term and ordinary life insuranceunder which the insurance company allocates the premium between the twothe imputed cost of any excess above   term plus the cost of theordinary life is taxable income to the individual advantage lies in a levelpremium for the ordinary life portion at the starting age making it moreattractive for personal continuation on retirement plus the accumulationof cash valueit is proposed to divide the coverage equally between ordinarylife and term for employees at or above the   salary level namelycontinue with one times salary of term and substitute the second one tim scma salary with ordinary life the estimated aggregate of increased cost tothe several employees that would qualify at their current salary levels is about  to the time of retirement whereas the aggregate cash valueof their policies at retirement would be about  contrasting with novalue at all from term insurance at whatever levelthe added cost to mca in the current year would approach  dropping to less than   after retirement of the first employeewho would qualify reduction of qualifications for term life insurance coverageformerly there was a linkage in the funding of the pension plan and groupterm life insurance thus making it logical to set the same age and servicequalifications for enrollment concurrent with the revision of the pensionplan two years ago however the funding arrangements of the two wereseparated and became independent of one anotherwhile it is legal for an age requirement to be stipulated as beingthe same as for pension coverage as mca now does it has been learned itwould be illegal to specify an age limitation as such it is proposed toeliminate the age requirement now  years rather than retain it on atechnicalityalso the present requirement of one year of service is an unusually long qualification period one to three months being more commonit is proposed to lower the requirement to three months this being theperiod now in effect to qualify for mcas medical benefitsthe cost of these changes would be minimal there are relatively few below age  on the staff premium rates for the young are low andtheir inclusion has an offsetting effect of lowering the average age of thecovered group the cost of the reduced service requirement would bemodest also considering the low turnover rate among highsalaried employeesmcacma exhibit freport by the director of government relationswilliam m stovernovember awsttess

pollster lou harris called the old roosevelt coalitionas the backbone of his campaign governor jimmy carter of georgiahas become presidentelect and is now hard at work on the massive taskof organizing his administrationrecent days have seen mr cartercloseted with such ford administration notables as george bush fora security briefing and henry kissinger to talk foreign affairsand at  this afternoon he is in personal conference with presidentford to discuss the transition of the governmentwashington bureaucrats politicians and diplomats are givingmr carter close scrutiny perhaps motivated by uneasiness anduncertainty as much as by mere curiosity after all jimmy carter hasrun as an antiestablishment candidate for nearly two yearshe hascriticized both the form and substance of government in washingtons vowed sweeping reforms and new programs has fought bitter campaigntles with recognized leaders of his own party  however on electionht he made a quick transition from critic on the outside to managern the insidejimmy carter now is the establishmentfecma and therefore he is now confronted with a dilemma of some delicacyhow to begin to direct and to motivate the people and the mechanismshe has so recently and soundly castigatedhe must find and appointcabinet heads and officeholders with the capacity to make the machineryof government work and this would seem to indicate a need for experienced personnel but at the same time he must avoid the appearanceof making his appointments from the lists of known political figuresand party professionals he needs new faces but he also needs thereliability and depth of background that only experience can providethere are signs that a number of carter appointments may berevealed relatively soon so that incoming officials will have maximumtime for planning and coordination with departing officials of theford administrationobservers around the world will be carefullywatching these appointments for clues to the attitudes of the carteradministration the influence being wielded by various interest groupsand powerbrokers and for indications as to the political wisdom ofthe presidentelect himselfamong the most delicate tasks confronting mr carter and one heappears to recognize clearly as such is the establishing of communications links with  and hopefully some measure of control over  thecongresshis recent meeting with  democratic congressional leaderslast week at the farmestate of georgia senator herman talmadge wassurely an effort to hold out the olive branch and to begin to buildsupport for key programsthe discussions were reportedly broad innature touching on matters relating to the strength of the economyandreorganization of governmentsome observers believe however that the new president mayencounter considerable difficulty with the congress despite thefact that both ends of pennsylvania avenue are now firmly indemocratic hands they reason it this way congressional leadersand committee chairmen while criticizing the stalemate governmentof presidents nixon and ford have obviously enjoyed the independence and status which the years of confrontation have producedtheyhave had an important role in punishing one president and in makinghis successor appear ineffectual and are therefore likely to covettheir independence of actionmoreover bills and programs delayedby attention to watergate or stalled by ford vetoes are already infairly polished form and are not likely to be dropped readily bytheir sponsors in favor of carter alternativesyet another factorwill be the attitude of the white house itself and longtime carterwatchers point out that he adopted a tough no compromise attitudetoward the georgia legislature during his term as governorcmamew president and his viewsmuch of official washington is now speculating on the futuresections of policy and programs in the carter administrationhowever from speeches and statements by the presidentelect andfrom the democratic party platform itself it is possible to reachsome preliminary judgmentswith respect to the economy governor carter appears firmly infavor of creating more jobs and providing stimulus to the nationaleconomy the prospect of a oneshot tax cut is being seriouslydiscussed the formation of a national youth corp to hire and trainyoung people from urban areas is another carter aim and is consistentwith bis support for direct job creation with emphasis on publicservice employment he also favors moderate interest rates continuedsupport of investment credits strong antitrust enforcement and astrengthening of the council on wage and price stabilitytax reformthough a popular topic at the campaign podium will take considerablylonger to accomplishthe environment will receive high priority in the carter

energyresponsibilitiescma exhibit greport to the board of directorsmanufacturing chemists associationjoseph sandford jr chairmanchemical packaging committeenovember the activities of the chemical packaging committeeemphasize two major areas  regulations and legislationourobjective today is to provide background on our committee operations and how we are assisting each of our companies to achieveboth safety in packaging and regulatory compliancetimes have changedjust a few years ago a chemicalpackaging engineer might be concentrating on the steel thicknessof a drum for solvents the moisture barrier in a bag for plasticresins or a fungicide box closuretoday he must also knowabout the transportation safety act of  the consolidationof dot regulations the metric conversion act of  international shipping regulations and looking to the future regulations on solid waste disposal and carcinogenswhat has caused this change in our committees activities we believe the most important factor is the concern onthe part of both the private and public sectors for greatersafety in the packaging transportation and distribution of hazardous materialsthe department of transportations past twoannual reports on hazardous materials control are more specificabout this concern over safetyin these two years  fatalitiesand over  injuries occurred in all hazardous materialsincidents of which over  involved chemical productsthe department of transportation or as we usually say dot alsolists the ten worst accidents for each year  of these involved chemical industry products with a total of nine fatalitiesand  people injuredit is for reasons like this that thecommittees activities emphasize regulations and legislationthe major legislative act affecting our activitiesis the transportation safety act of  passed by congressin early key points includethe d partment of transportations authority isextended to regulate package unloading certaintypes of storage and shipment routingcma procedures for obtaining package exemptions aremade much more complexdot authority is extended to container manufacturersand even to commodities not presently defined ashazardouscriminal as well as civil penalties can be imposedfor violations with imprisonment for up to fiveyears now includedin the regulatory field dot has just issued itscomplete consolidation of title  of the code of federalregulations which contains the regulations governing the transportation and packaging of hazardous materialsthis documenthas been over four years in preparation and incorporates manyregulatory changes affecting the use labeling marking andshipment of chemical packagesthe metric conversion act has been enacted into lawit creates a metric board to oversee voluntary conversion in theunited stateswe believe metrication will initially affect ourexport packaging with domestic packages going metric over thenext ten yearsour liaison with canadian mca member companies is providing valuable input based on their experience in metricconversionexport shipments require industry packaging personnelto be aware of united nations and xmco regulations and appropriaterail and truck regulations in the various countries to which weshipthe regulations of imco or more properly the intergovernmental maritime consultative organization are contained in aneightvolume set covering water movement of hazardous materialssolid waste disposal legislation recently enactedhas not affected packaginghowever legislation proposed butnot passed would have imposed a fee on packaging materialsthat are not reusable or recyclableregulations and legislation while deeply involved withsafety also have an economic effect on packagingdot recognizesthis to a degree and has introduced the term costbenefit to beconsidered in any reviews of package regulation changespackagingis a significant cost item in our industrythe chemical industryuses over  million new and reconditioned steel and fibre drumsannually at a cost of about  millionthe industry usesabout seven billion square feet of corrugated fibreboard in boxesto hold our plastics agricultural chemicals and acids at ancmaannual cost of  millionwe use some  million bags and million pallets a yearthe total annual cost of packagingmaterials in our industry approaches  billion or about of salesperhaps of equal importance from a solid waste disposalstandpoint this represents in the range of one billion poundsof steel one and a half billion pounds of paperboard and million pounds of woodthe agendas and organization of the committees taskgroups and subcommittees reflect our concern over regulationsand legislationa few examples illustrate the positive actionwe are taking to assist our industryfirst we recently formed a new regulations and legislation subcommittee to control all of our activities in thisarea such as metrication definitions of hazardous materialsliaison with dot and our activities on the intercommittee groupon international regulationsour metrication task group coordinates committeeactivity with initial efforts emphasizing proper inclusion ofm trication in dot regulations and coordination of differencesin export and domestic regulationsthe small packages subcommittee is developing a technical bulletin on proper packaging and transportation of samplesand small quantitiesa task group has developed technical bulletins onproper techniques for loading bracing and blocking in truckrail car and piggyback shipmentsdot regulations requiresafe loading but dont really specify effective techniquesa newly proposed hazardous materials regulation specified testing requirements that current acid carboys would notpassa task group worked closely with suppliers to develop anew carboy design that met all requirementsa recent change in the definition and test for corrosivematerials meant that drums currently used for products such asdyes cleaning compounds or mining reagents were no longer legalthe drum subcommittee coordinated industry input and succeededin having a new section added in title  to cover these lowerhazard products and allow continued use of present packagescma the increasing complexity and many changes in theregulations created a need for greater awareness on the part ofour employees as well as those in our carrier and distributororganizationsthe committee together with the transportationequipment and transportation and distribution committees sponsored a symposium on hazardous materials regulations with over attendees from all concerned shipper and carrier groupsas to the future each subcommittee has an active taskgroup reviewing waste disposal effects on our packages includingpossible reuse and recyclethe plastic drum task group recentlysponsored a workshop on plastic drum development with dot thenational bureau of standards which is dots contracting agencyon plastic drum developments and representatives from the plasticdrum institute the producers associationhopefully thisjoint approach which we consider to be a significant breakthroughwill provide the forum for full participation by all groups inregulations development and applicationin the future we mayhave an entirely new class of hazardous materials to package sincedot has already indicated they have under development regulationsapplying to the proper packaging and transportation of healthproducts such as carcinogens mutagens and teratogensthe chemical packaging committee activities far exceed earlier efforts in the design and development of drums bags orboxes to safely carry our productswe must consider the productitself and any potential health hazard the package and packaging operation to insure we meet dot regulations the transportationand distribution requirements such as proper loading bracingand blocking customers must be able to safely use our packagesand looking to the future we must be able to return them orprovide safe reuse or disposal to prevent solid waste problemsin summary we believe our responsibility is to assistthe chemical industry to meet all legal requirements while maintaining a lowrisk position in transportation with proper costbenefit considerationsand we intend to make known the positionof our industry on legislative and regulatory matterswe have emphasized today the effect of regulationsand legislation on

that of a reelected politicianits important to assess what was said to this audience last yearin  the public relations committee report covered two mainpoints for future action that we would focus more sharply on major opportunities as wellas the larger problems of the chemical industry and that we would establish closer relationships with other functionalareas of mca so a more meaningful contribution to the industrystotal communications could be madethese things have been donethe assaults on the chemical industry by media and government inthe past  months have made it imperativein addition theopportunity to participate in dr heckerts special committee ontoxic substances legislation demonstrated what can be accomplishedthrough interaction of functions when proper leadership is providedspurred by todays public demands and the proof that joint committeeaction can get things done the public relations committee steppedtip its practice of meeting with the leadership of certain otherfunctional committees particularly government relations technicaland legal advisorythis was started about  months ago to gain a better perspectiveof mcas needs what we have found is that we can work together that we can have a common purpose and pursuit we have agreedupon issues that should be the greatest concern of the associationthese are human health and the environment and increasing government constraints which erode industrys management of its resourcescooperation to date has prompted us to adopt a plan for industryspokesmanship encompassing an even larger number of functionalcommitteesthe plan was proposed by a former chairman of our committee nedbrandt of dow and adopted at our september meeting most of thecommittees we have approached have already responded favorablythese committees are air quality water resources solid wasteoccupational health government relations legal advisory andchemical regulations advisorycma the plan calls for establishing a task force with representativesof those committees and the public relations committee to stimulatespokesmanship on the public issueseach committee will be asked to provide basic facts and a statementrepresenting mcas position on their function as related to government health and environment the air quality committee forexample will provide facts on what the chemical industry has doneabout air pollution and provide the industry position on currentlegislative and regulatory mattersmembers of the task force would serve as coordinators of the projectrecruit the best possible spokesmen from mcas membership and arrangeplatforms in leading cities where maximum exposure to our point of view can be gained we have in mind prestigious platforms like theeconomic club of detroit with accompanying appearances on localradio and tv plus newspaper interviewsthe task force would be responsible for placing industry materialin the hands of selected spokesmen coordinating appearances on ageographic basis and making sure that the load was properly spreadamong the member companieseach speaker would develop his topic in his own way weaving inthe mcadeveloped material at willthe type of spokesmen we have in mind are you gentlemen thedirectors of mca supported by other chief executive officers notpresent todaythe plan has both short and longrange advantages the short rangeis obvious  to gain some badly needed statements of the chemicalindustry point of view in various media the longer range advantagewill be gained as we build up this corps of spokesmen mca has aconstant need for industry experts who can provide statements andmake appearances on relatively short noticenews media as you know will use responses to issues and handlethe other sides position when the story is breakingthere isno public relations benefit in a tardy responseits eitherignored or becomes a liability as its availability provides themedia opportunity to retell the whole sordid storywe hope to get this plan underway in early it goes without saying that all ongoing pr programs are beingdirected toward the same issues to which the spokesmanship planwill be addressedcma ichemecology will expand further its coverage of member companysuccess stories in the areas of environment and toxic substancesparticipation next april in the american women in radio andtelevision spokesmanship program

barbourof rohm and haas reported to you in september of  we havebeen concerned primarily with the legislative activity which ledup to enactment of the tax reform act of  on october last year when the house ways and means committee conductedts h aring on tax reform i had the honor to testify on behalffj th associationafter passing the house late in  the tax reform actwas referred to the senate where it underwent hearings in thesenate finance committee this past springat that time as youwill recall mr f perry wilson chairman of the board ofunion carbide appeared on behalf of the associationour testimony before both committees was devoted to twoprincipal areas  namely capital formation and taxation offoreign source incomein the capital formation area we recommended the adoptionof such tax incentives as making the  investment tax creditpermanent reducing the corporate income tax rate and providingadditional cost recovery allowances we contended these actionsare needed to assist industry to generate sufficient fundsinternally to meet capital requirementsin the foreign area we recommended that no change be made inthe foreign tax credit provisions and none with respect to thetiming of the imposition of us tax on foreign earnings of foreignsubsidiaries the socalled deferral issuein order to stimulateports and to improv our balancof payments position we alsoecommended that the disc be retainedcma the tax reform act as finally enacted pl  is amassive document containing many hundreds of provisions which willtouch every taxpayer corporate and individual in the countryi understand that bill stover briefed you gentlemen in septemberon the more significant provisions of the bill as agreed to by thehousesenate conference committeeas these provisions remainedbasically unchanged on final passage of the legislation  willpoint out a few areas which the new law does not addressjiiaside from extending theinvestment tax credit through the act does little to assist capital formationalthough a taskforce of the house ways and means committee headed by chairmana ullman of oregon conducted a study to consider the use of thetax code to stimulate capital formation it has not yet publishedits reportjiin the foreign source income area the new tax law has anumb r of disturbing provisions but it did not deal to any basicextent with the two items of major concern to industry namely thetiming of taxation of foreign source income socalled deferraland the foreign tax credityou will recall that a group of taxreformminded senators sponsored amendments to require currenttaxation of the income of foreign subsidiaries of us companiesand to change the foreign tax credit to a deduction but theirproposals were all defeatedfthe house ways and means committee also set up a task forceheaded by representative rostenkowski dill to study thetaxation of foreign incomeno report has been issued and wehave no indication as to what recommendations are likely to beforthcomingconsidering the initial attitude of the thcongress we believe our industry was most fortunate to emergewith the major tax provisions affecting foreign source incomerelatively intactfthe mca tax policy committee has also been active withresp ct to recent rulemaking proposals initiated by the internalrevenue servicewe have been particualrly concerned with a proposal to amendsection  of the income tax regulations which relates to theallocation and apportionment of deductions for income tax purposesas you will recall without the benefit of change in the law orcourt decisions in  the treasury department proposed revis dregulations which would cause most companies to lose substantialitiifcma iforeign tax creditsmca went on record in  and again in opposing the regulations and recommending that they be withdrawnbecause of industrys strong opposition these proposed regulationswere never finalizedwithin the past year there has been a great deal of renewedgovernmental activity regarding these regulations and the internalrevenue service and the treasury department appeared anxious tofinalize themin the meantime the economic policy board becameinterested in the  issuethat board established a task forcecomposed of representatives of a number of federal agenciesincluding the departments of commerce and treasury and the councilon international economic policy to study the problemduring the past year the treasury department proposed a seriesof compromises aimed at overcoming industry opposition to theproposed regulationsmembers of our tax policy committee have hada number of meetings with representatives of treasury and the councilon international economic policy concerning the regulations andh suggested treasury revisionsit was the opinion of a majority of the tax policy committeemembers that the treasury departments suggested changes to the proposed regulations did not go far enough to make theregulations acceptable to the chemical industrytherefore we havecontinued to oppose the proposed regulationsour opposition hasbeen directed primarily at those provisions of the regulationswhich would require that a portion of domestic r  d expense beallocated against a companys foreign incomein the case of acompany with large r  d expenditures this could have the effectof substantially reducing that companys foreign tax creditresulting in significant double taxationii might mention that there was a minority view within thetax policy committee recommending support for the treasuryproposal to reissue the proposed regulations in modified formproviding we made it clear that we reserved the right to objectto the proposed regulations after we have had an opportunity tostudy themthis view was based on the thought that the revisedproposal represented a substantial improvement over the original proposalthis view was not shared by the majority of ourcommitteecma because of a united front on these questions by many organizations including mca the machinery and allied products institutethe national foreign trade council and others we understood theissu was dead for we were quite surprised therefore whenthe internal revenue service published the revised regulations inproposed form on november thwe understand that this action wastaken by the treasury department without clearing the subject withthe economic policy boardthe new proposals are quite complicated and our member companiesare currently studying them to determine their effectit is apparentthat the impact can be different from company to company dependentupon various business factors and we anticipate differences ofiopinion as to whether mca should support or oppose the provisionsa written statement will be prepared based on comments to be receivedfrom our members by november thpublic hearings will be held inwashington on december th and it is anticipated that a representaitive of the tax policy committee will appearin conclusion i would like to state that we faced  witha great deal of trepidation as to the final effect of the taxreform act of we were quite active in attempting to presentthe chemical industrys viewpoint and feel quite relieved to havecome through the year as well as we didwe now face the coming year in anticipation of greater taxactivityour goal remains to obtain legislation to aid in capitalformation and hopefully an enlightened attitude in congress withregard to the necessity to maintain our competitiveness abroadwe are commencing this year with hearing activity on the section regulations and anticipate further activity as regulations onthe boycott and illegal payments provisions are publishedin other words your tax policy committee has had a busyyear and expects to remain active and

newincome tax regulations relating to the allocation and apportionmentof deductions to gross income to determine taxable income fromsources within and without the united states  the sorcalledsection  regulationsinitially proposed in  they were withdrawn and reproposedin revised form last november mca submitted written commentsstrongly opposing the  proposal then testified at a publichearing in  recommending that the proposed rules be withdrawnthe revised proposed regulations issued last november met a numberof our earlier objections but still contained provisions which weconsidered burdensome we then submitted written comments on therevised proposal questioning the issuance of regulations in theabsence of enabling legislation and recommending additional changesa member of our tax policy committee presented our testimony at anirs hearing in middecemberthe final regulations are substantially similar to those issuedlast november but certain clarifying amendments were adoptedbasically they will cause an increase in the amount of deductionsexpenses and losses of u s taxpayers required to be allocatedto foreign gross income the allowable foreign tax credit willbe proportionately reduced because taxable income from sourcesabroad determined under the new rules will almost always be lessthan that which would be determined under the old regulationsthe effect of the new regulations on individual companies islikely to vary widely depending on factors such as the scope offoreign operations the quantity of research and development activity performed within the united states and the amount ofdomestic interest expensein late november the tax policy committee was polled on thestrategy question of whether or not to request a delay for thesubmission of comments on the new revised regulations the committee opinion was evenly divided and no consensus could bereachedrnow that the regulations have been finalized some membercompani s may wish to chall nge the

chemists associationjohn j moyna chairmanfood drug and cosmetic chemicals committeejanuary i welcome this opportunity to acquaint you with some of theareas of our committees concern in the past year and some of thelegal and regulatory problems confronting the food additive andpharmaceutical segments of the industry in the year aheadin the area of major new legislation we anticipate thatcongress will act on the food surveillance billthis bill waspassed by the senate in  and was under active consideration bythe rogers committee in the house when congress adjournedamongits principal provisions is a requirement for the registration withfda of all plants which manufacture foods or food chemicalsitkill also impose on every segment of the food processing industryrthe obligation of selfpolicing by each manufacturers establishmentand adherence to adequate safety assurance procedures appropriate tohis plantthese procedures are to identify areas in the manufacturing process in which product adulteration is likely or possibleand set forth and implement effective measures to reduce or eliminate the risk of adulterationthe  senate bill offered noguidelines on determining the adequacy of the safety assuranceprocedures and the vagueness of the new law may present substantialcompliance problemsanother important area which the senate bill addressed andwhich we believe congress will act upon in  is the impact ofthe us supreme court decision in us v parkin the park casethe supreme court ruled that a corporate executive could be prosecuted under the criminal provisions of the food drug  cosmeticact for product adulteration irrespective of his personal ignoranceof the situation causing the adulteration and however remote hisinvolvement in that situationthe court thus imposed absolutecriminal liability based merely upon the responsibility of individualcorporate officers for certain areas of activitythe consumer foodlegislation would limit the criminal responsibility of executives tothose situations in which the adulteration arose from some negligence or intentional conduct on the part of the responsible companycma officialin the same vein the food  drug administration willissue regulations implementing and defining its policy under thepark decisionour committee will be following both those developments very closelyother requirements of the new legislation willbe extensive recordkeeping and reporting requirements and codingand labeling requirements designed to expedite recallsin the regulatory areas fda has already published proposedregulations for good laboratory practices designed to insure theaccuracy and sufficiency of test data submitted to the agency insupport of new drug applications food and color additive petitionsand similar applications where fda approval is requiredour involvedsubcommittees will undertake to determine the appropriateness ofsubmitting comments on these proposed regulationsadditional areas of regulatory activity and concern willinclude fdas gras review of food chemicalsa subject on which ourcommittee has submitted extensive comments in the pastand the potential impact of the toxic substances legislation upon food drug cosmetic chemicalsi would like to say a few words on the lattersubjectupon initial review ofhe toxic substances legislation manyof the regulatory affairs and legal people in the pharmaceuticaland food industries took comfort from what seemed to be a totalexemption from coverage accorded to foods drugs and cosmeticsoncloser scrutiny however it becomes apparent that intermediate chemicals used in the manufacture of finished food additives and drugsmay well be covered by the new lawthe question of the applicabilityof the toxic substances legislation to drug and food chemical intermediates requires early resolution because of the consequences whichattend noninclusion of a chemical in epas inventory of oldchemical substances under the actif in fact all intermediatesare covered by the new law pharmaceutical and food chemical manufacturers will probably be required to report all intermediates toepa in order to avoid the consequences of new chemical statushopefully our committee will be able to make some input to epa on thisimportant questionepa has requested suggestions of all interestedpersons on its prospective administration of the toxic substanceslaw and plans to hold a number of public hearings to solicit furthercommentso much for the year aheadi wouldlike to comment verycma ibriefly on our committees activities for the past yearthecommittee drafted recommended comments for mca on the pdas recallregulations in september of mca had previously commentedon the agencys general procedural regulations governing administrative hearingsthese comments represent a considerable commitment of time and effort on the part of individual members of ourcommitteein its final administrative procedure regulations fdarecognized the validity of many of our points and indicated thatits implementation of the regulations would take into account theconcerns we expressedthe effectiveness of our committeeand of mcaas an industryvoice is to some extent limited by the limited time in which to submitcomments to the agency and the mca committee structure itself which relies almost completely on the work product of the committee membersin the last regard i believe that the committees effectivenesscould be enhanced by more direct mca staff involvement with fdarepresentatives on issues of general interest and by more activestaff participation in the preparation of written input on agencyproposalsthis is intended as recognition of limitations inherentin mcas method of operation not as a reflection on the staffi am grateful for this opportunity to give you some idea ofour committees activities and concerns and welcome any specificquestions you may havecma exhibit emca industrial relations advisory committee reportto theboard of directorsjanuary  john j radigan chairmanin september  i had the privilege of speaking to theboard of directors to report on the industrial relations advisorycommittees activitiesat that time i took a few minutes tocrystalball what i saw in the near future in the broad area ofindustrial relationsas i indicated in my projections we haveseen relatively high inflation continue through  coupled withhigh increases in wages at all levelsnew and improved fringeben fits including dental plans have become commonplace and wehav witnessed a strong push for job security fueled by the recessionin my opinion even though inflation has slowed down andhop fully will continue to do so wages will rise in excess of thecurrent level of inflation and fringe benefits together with jobs curity will become the main thrust of organized laborotherforms of insurance programs such as those covering automobiles andlegal fees will reach the bargaining tableas to job security we shall see in the next three to fiveyears a definite major breakthrough in this area which will spillover into most of our major companies and industries with such innovations as guaranteed work weeks no time cards etca keynegotiation to watch in this regard is that between the basic steelindustry and the united steelworkers of americathe initial sessionis scheduled for february  and they will continue voluntary negotiations until april  at which time any unresolved national contractissues will be submitted to arbitration under the experimentalnegotiation agreementthe arbitration panel is to issue its decisionno later than july security is shaping up as a major itemsince costofliving protection and a standardofliving increase areforegone conclusionsthis includes income security and employment security and could include costofliving adjustments onvacations pensions and insurance benefits and further restrictionson contractingout of worka shorter work week and additional paiddays off could also be in thpicturealthough there has b en a great deal of talk about codetermination and works councils migrating from europe i do not think theycma will become a part of our industrial life here in the united stafasat least not in the near future  and if at all not in the sameform as we are experiencing in europetwo other areas which will stand out for increased futureactivity are occupational safety and health and equal employmentopportunitywhether you have unions or not your employees arebecoming more aware of their rights in these areasif you haveunions many are building technical staffs in the safety hygieneand health fields to aid their locals in auditing the safety ofour work placesseveral companies in our industry have experiencedemployee health crises in the last year with the resulting employeeand public relations problemswe must be prepared to devote moremanagement time and resources to avoid further employee anxietiesabout the safety of their work

unions caniexpect to hear more about health and safety in future negotiationsunions are impatient with oshaindeed one  the oil chemical andatomic workers  is suing oshawe should expect that this impatiencewill result in a more direct approach with employers includingdemands for safety committees with authority use of union safetyconsultants in our plants and higher visibility for such

areutilizing all available forums to resolve their discrimination complaints  grievance procedures local and state human rights commissions the eeoc the employers compliance agency as well asprivate equal employment groupsunion leadership will push tobecome more involved in our equal employment opportunity effortspartly out of a new interest and partly to protect themselves fromdiscrimination charges from their new female and minority memberscma this will continue to burden us with timeconsuming and expensiveinvestigations and litigationshowever i forecast an even moredifficult time as the concept of affirmative action is applied tothe employment and upgrading of professional employeesourabilities as managers to plan organize control evaluate andmotivate will be tested as never

give overriding priority to measures to revive theeconomy and reduce unemployment rather than to their ownparochial interestsit is clear that the incoming administration is similarly inclined though not clear whether it is asenthusiastic as labor in support of the humphreyhawkins billhowever after the administration and the congress havedone what they can about unemployment the unions will be

of an increase in the tax rate now and taxable wage base  in   the latter to movewith wages and salaries generallyhowever there is strong sentiment among some legislators to tap general revenues andor to dispense with any ceiling on the taxable wage base but without commensurate increase in benefits for higherpaid persons no change is in the offing in the age requirements for receiptof old age benefits under social securityhowever the concept ofmandatory retirement at any given age under privatelysponsored pension plans is coming under increasing fire from social scientistsand othersthus it is possible that congress may authorize a studyof the mandatory retirement age concept which ultimately but not in could be the basis for legislation affecting this provision ofmost pension plansthe coming year is likely to bring adjustments in the medicareand medicaid areas due to the escalating costs of medical servicesthere will be many proposals in the national health insurancearea ranging from the equivalent of catastrophic illness coverageto complete coveragethere will be considerable range too in thedegree of employer financial support required under the various proposalswith the carter administration committed to action in thisfield enactment sooner or later of some national health insuranceplan seems certainit could conceivably be enacted in  to beeffective in however in

assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health a year ago morton corn immediatelyset about to make the occupational safety and health administrationa more professional organizationthe perception of osha by thepublic government and industry at the time was highly unflatteringmorton corn has not yet succeeded in reversing that view but isdetermined to do sohe has made headway toward making osha a morecomp tent organizationif he remains in the office under thecarter administration he will continue to increase the technicalcompetence of the osha staff to work for reorganization of

programsas proposed this program would establish three groups of employersthose who would be required to comply with osha standards thosewho could deviate from osha standards on a standardbystandardbasis and those who could establish their own safety programs aftera probationary periodoshas examination of this proposed programapparently was generated by a finding that  of all deaths andinjuries in industry are not attributable to violations of oshaspecification or performance standardsthe proposed program isaimed at encouraging companies not only to meet osha standards butto have a safety education and training program to have sufficientqualified safety personnel to have employee participation in thesafety program etcwhether or not a company adequately meetsthese

relations committee reportto the board of directorsfebruary  don a goodall chairmana major premise of this report is that business isnot as influential in washington as we would like it tobe nor as influential as we must be if any viable formof private enterprise is to be preserved in this countryit was not too many years ago that businessmen werelistened to with considerable attention by those membersof congress who wore either a republican or southern democrat labelbut that is no longer the case what happenedwhen i first came to washington in  one of thepower houses on the hill was judge smith of virginia amid school southern democrat and head of the then allpowerful house rules committeeif he decided he didntwant a bill passed he wouldnt give it a rule permittingit to go to the house floorif the pressure got toogr at he just went down to his farm to  as he used toim not saying this was the right way to run thegovernmentbut it was a time when businessmen had moreinfluence in congress than we have todaybut that daywent out with the oneman onevote drive that took placemore than a decade ago and for a variety of other reasonsfor example the politicizing of labor unions wasanother contributing factorbeginning in  with establishment of the committee on political education labormoved into the political ring in a big way convincedthat it could win in state legislatures and the congresswhat it could not win at the bargaining tablelabormoney and labor manpower are now major factors in congressional election campaignsand labors lobbying muscleon capitol hill is the envy of those of us on the businesssideitelevision is another factor that has changed theprocess of selecting and influencing members of congressthe medium puts a premium on an appearance of freshnessf youthful vigor and vitality and on the ability toarticulate ideasfurth rmore the wide exposure tv givescma to candidates tends to open up the selection processanother and more recent development has been the riseof public interest groupsthey are dedicated and perseveringa member of congress must be responsive totheir pressures or else hell find himself facing morecompetition for his seat in the next primary and generalelectionsbusiness has not been totally unresponsive to thesechanging factors with the rise of big government andbig labor after wwii some large companies opened washington offices to assure that their views were beingconveyed to congress and the administrationat thesame time that the washington corporate office was beingdeveloped by a relative handful of companies  must addthere was a parallel development of the trade associationas an instrument for communicating with governmentinthe last two decades trade associations have become asmuch a washington growth phenomenon as government itselfand finally within the last few years we have evenseen the ceo coming to washington to engage in directlobbying where an issue was of such paramount importanceto the corporation that it merited his personal attentionthis technique became so important in fact that thebusiness roundtable was formed expressly to assure organizedceo involvement in the lobbying effortbut the washington corporate office and the tradeassociation and the ceo as lobbyists are not totallyresponsive to todays needwhat business lacks is a grassroots voicemanymembers of congress are candid in saying this to yourwashington corporate representativeright or wrongmembers of congress are telling us that opinions fromthe corporate board room no longer carry the weight theyonce didin the vernacular of capitol hill they askhow many votes have you gotunfortunately too many in business fail to understand that to a politician the vote tally on election daytis the endall and beall in the same manner as is toyou the bottom line on your corporate financial statementicma how do we get a grassroots voice on capitol hillwe start by developing two resources that presently arelargely untapped by business  employees and stockholdersfirst we give our employees an understanding ofhow our businesses work an understanding of the kind ofgovernmental climate that must exist for preservation ofprivate enterprise and an understanding of how theirpersonal welfare relates to that of the corporationlest anyone assume that this is not a bonafide needi quote from the january issue of the conference boardmagazine which said of the american people  theymisunderstand the relationships between prices and costsand between real wages productivity and capital investment they overestimate the level of corporate profitmargins and they believe that it is business not peoplewho pays the corporate income taxif we help our employees understand these thingsthen they will see that their congressional representativesunderstand themthe stockholder is not so much in need of economicducation as he is of being informed about how prospectivegovernment actions will affect the

conable takes the positions hedoeswithout such backup mr conable is vulnerablemr talcotts reference to a union leader doesnt meanthat union leaders are more persuasive than businessmenit simply means that from a congressmans perception unionspokesmen presently represent more votes than we dothat perception is certainly true in mr talcottscasehes no longer in congress thanks to labor unionand environmentalist political cloutbryce harlow counsellor to presidents and procter gambles washington representative has an interestingconcept of this matter of perceptionshe says that whena politician looks at you as a company executive or meas a washington representative or at mca he looks throughus  as though we were a windowhe wants to see what isbehind us to determine if we can hurt him or help himtoo often the politician sees nothing behind us andwhen he does he knows he can ignore our viewscma sd much then for the need for grassroots supportif our positions are to prevail in washingtonit isnot my intent nor have we time for the mechanics ofhow this will be accomplishedexcept that it will not be done by slick pr techniques nor by writing a check once a year to some organization that promises you it can educate the american publicabout free enterprisenow let me shift focus to another subject but whichis related to all that lve said so far like one sideof a coin is related to the otherbusiness cannot be persuasive either to its ownemployees or to congress if it lacks credibilityand business has a credibility problem stemming fromsuch things as price fixing bribery and environmentalincidentsi do not believe that except for a few amoralbusinessmen todays corporate leaders consciouslycondone breaking the lawrather these things happenbecause not enough attention is paid to establishingcontrols that will prevent themand so i make this suggestionthat every companyhave a system of internal auditing which has the expresspurpose of identifying for management potential problemareas within the corporationxt is my belief thatsomewhere in any company there are always individualswho know when the fine line of illegality is being crossedor some practice is being followed that is questionablefrom an environmental safety or health viewthere mustbe a way for these people to report their concerns sothat management can take corrective steps before irretrievable damage is done  both to the company and tothe business imageim not advocating dogoodismgulfs ceo announcedrecently that it has set up a system that gives its divisional finance officers an opportunity to report problemanother mca company xm told has recently instituted an auditing procedure in the health and safety areaso this is a practical suggestioncma in summary i have suggested to you that we shoulddo two things to help preserve private enterprise firstenlist the participation of our employees and stockholdersand second establish an internal method for identifyingpotential problem areasif you feel that these suggestions have merit the government relations conmittee isready to work with you in designing a model program whichyou can adapt to your own

although afrom the council on environmental quality becametext has not been issuedcma itimoreover there are signs that the delay is due at least inpart to potential conflicts with elements of another majorpresidential program  the energy message scheduled to be deliveredby the president april the close interrelationship and tradeoffs between energy and environmental concerns are well recognizedas is the political volatility of each factors which may have ledto late modificationsthe draft environmental message written for the president byceq centers around  issues oil pollution prevention air andwater pollution control protection of life and health resourceconservation and recovery assessment and improvement of environmental laws energy natural resources living resources globalenvironment urban environment and parks recreation and wilderness early reports on the initial page draft indicated thatit offered little in the way of compromises or tradeoffs in theinterest of increased energy supplythe energy message has apparently undergone some revisionin recent days with rumors of a move away from mandatory acrosstheboard efficiency standards for industry and toward efficiencystandards for industrial equipment by working with the manufacturersregardless it is certain that the mandatory approach is stillfavored by some vocal and influential members of congress and thatvoluntary industrial efficiency programs or conservation effortswill come under attack the carter plan is also expected to callfor a retrofit program to weatherize homes performancebasebuilding codes for new building types and energyefficiency standardsfor large appliances other possibilities include a surtax ongasguzzling vehicles higher fuel economy goals for new carsand a standby increase in the

economic stimulusion monday march  the senate finance committee filed thei report on its version of the taxation aspects of president carterseconomic stimulus program h r  the tax reduction and simplificma cation act of  there is uneasiness about the vote count however and the senate leadership deferred floor consideration untilafter easter recessthe key question appears to be the  taxrebate but an additional complication is the apparent backlashamong democratic members who resent mr carters recent cuts instate water projectsinsofar as industry is concerned the major differences betweenhouse and senate bills thus far are in the tax incentives areathe house version provides only for a new jobs credit of for each new employee with a ceiling of  credit for eachcompany the senate version gives companies an option to take anew jobs credit somewhat similar to the one in the house bill orto choose the investment tax credit increased from  to the option was contained in the original administration proposala major floor fight is of course expected on the  taxrebate but another key question will be senator javits expectedamendment to substitute a permanent reduction in personal incometaxes for the rebate this approach should receive solid supportfrom the  senate republicans but it is doubtful that enoughdemocrats will join in mr carter has hinted a veto of any bill containing a tax reduction because the administration considersthat a central part of its reform package expected this fallconservative democrats may sponsor an amendment to delete therebate without substituting any permanent tax reductionanother floor amendment fight could arise over a bill introduced by senator frank church s  which would terminatethe deferral of taxation of foreign source income there is agood possiblity that he may propose the substance of this billas an amendment to the tax reduction and simplification act duringfloor considerationif senator church does introduce his deferral amendmentthere is a real danger that it may carrylast year a similaramendment was defeated by the margin of a single votesincethe house defeated the common situs picketing bill many senatorsas well as representatives are anxious for an opportunity tocast a prolabor vote labor is on record opposing thedeferral concept contending it encourages the export of jobsand so the church amendment might furnish senators an opportunityto mend their labor fenceswe have alerted the members of our government relations andtax policy committees asking that they urge senators with whomthey have a constituent relationship to vote against such anamendmentcma status of the arab boycott situationthere are two important areas of activity with respect tothe arab boycott situation the first being in existing tax lawunder the tax reform act of  the socalled ribicoff amendmentdenied various tax benefits to companies participating in orcooperating with an international boycottthe treasury department has subsequently issued two sets of guidelines relating tothe boycott provisions of the ctour tax policy committee has studied these guidelines and isof the opinion that both the boycott provisions of the tax reformact and the guidelines themselves need further clarificationwe have therefore arranged for a meeting april  with treasuryofficials to discuss the problem on april  irs is holdinga public hearing on the guidelines we expect either to requestto testify or to submit a statement at that hearing and willdetermine which approach to take after our meeting with treasurythe second area in which the arab boycott question is beingdiscussed is in pending amendments to the export administrationact the house international relations committee and the senatebanking committee have both reported bills amending the exportadministration act to prohibit u s companies from participatingin foreign boycottsthe senate banking committee ordered s  reported onapril  and expects to bring it to the floor soon after theeaster recessthe house international relations committee reported aclean bill hr  on april  and will request a rule onapril  house floor consideration is expected soon thereafterthough similar the antiboycott provisions of the house andsenate bills have some differencesthe senatebill would provide an exception for u s firmsoperating in boycotting countries allowing them to comply withlocal law with respect to activities exclusively within thosecountries the house bill contains no such provisionthe house bill will allow u s persons to comply with aboycotters designation of a u s transaction provided that thisexception would not apply in cases where the u s firm hasactual knowledge that the sole purpose of the designation is toimplement the boycott the senate provision on unilateralselection contains no such limitationcma the carter government reorganization planon april  president carter signed into public law a majorgovernment reorganization bill thus moving toward fullfillmentof a principal campaign promisereorganization of the sprawlingand overlapping federal bureaucracyevery president since hoover has had reorganization authoritybut the law was allowed to expire on april   because ofthe watergate controversy and congressional displeasure over whatit considered usurpation of power by the executive branchduring hearings in the house government operations committeechairman jack brooks dtx was adamantly opposed to giving thepresident this power without a tight congressional leash hewanted a bill which would require congressional approval of anyproposed reorganization planbrooks claimed the legislativeveto approach was unconstitutionalthe president has vetopower congress the power to overridepresident carter howeversucceeded in convincing government operations committee membersof the need for reorganization powers much the same as those heldby preceding presidentsbrooks was forced to relent and thehouse eventually passed the bill on march  by a vote of the senate had no problem with the reorganization issue andpassed its bill march  by a vote of differences were quickly resolved in the joint conferenceand the following provisions became law presidential authority to submit government reorganizationplans for three years from enactment date plans to be effective automatically unless either housevetoes within  days following submission senate governmental affairs and the house governmentoperations committees have jurisdiction over all plans congress may not amend a plan the president estimates cost increases or reductions oreach plan and expected improvement in efficiency a resolution of disapproval is to be introduced automatically as the president submits a plan the

oxidant study from mr files andothers at your board meeting last monthour committee thinksit is an important study and one that epa will not be able toignorei believe it will be useful to emphasize several aspects of the oxidant problemcma epa s oxidant standard is being exceeded in every statethat has taken measurementsit is not a texas problem alonefew believe in the standard including dr knelson directorof epas health effects research laboratorythe api petitionto epa which mca supports questions the standard and the control strategy to attain the standardbest evidence indicatesthe standard will not be changed significantlyhowever epastrategy to attain the standard is being tightened and willrequire offsets for new sourcesfor example new hydrocarbonemissions located in areas where the oxidant standard is notbeing met must somehow accomplish reductions in existing emissions to more than offset the added emissionsthis problemand epas proposed offset solution are the result of clean airact languagemr polzers recent testimony on behalf of mcabefore the senate and house strongly emphasized the need forrelief if orderly development in the nation is to continueactually we are on strong technical ground in saying thatoxidant is relatively insensitive to changes in hydrocarbonsand that hydrocarbons cannot be controlled sufficiently inmost places to attain the oxidant standardlos angeles is aprime examplein  years that county has reduced hydrocarbons from stationary source emissions by  and from vehicleslast year they exceeded the oxidant standard on over daysepa knows we cannot attain the standard in many placesbut their new strategy is to make progress towards it by attempting to reduce high oxidant concentrations in large metropolitanareas and hence reduce the numbers of people at riskthisphilosophy agrees with mcas recent congressional testimonyurging congress to modify the zero risk concept currently inherent in the actthere is technical evidence that we canmake progress but at enormous cost to control stationary sourcesand by imposition of drastic curtailment of vehicles by anunwilling publicthere are potential environmental hazardshowever to epa emphasis on hydrocarbon controlsthe deemphasis on controlling oxides of nitrogen a partner in photochemical reactions can cause the smog problem to spread furtherinto rural areas and lead to a buildup of oxides of nitrogen andpose yet another potential health riskthis is precisely whatis happening in the areas contiguous to los angeles mca hasconveyed to epa our committees belief that hydrocarbon offsetis unworkablecma while some adjustments in offset requirements now appearlikely epa is not abandoning its broader thesis and has notified  states to revise their hydrocarbon control regulationsby mid we face public hearings in all these statespresently it is unclear if or how the association should handlethese individual statesi certainly recommend we gear up tohandle regional problems such as the  northeastern states currently banding together to write uniform hydrocarbon standardsclean air act amendmentswhile i have mentioned problems with nonattainment of theoxidant

organic chemical manufacturing industry studyanother area of concern to us is the epa study of thesynthetic organic chemical industry their purpose is todevelop federal new source performance standards and guideline documents for states to use in developing retrofit regulations for existing sourcesthis is a two to three yeareffortepas reasons for this study are that organics formphotochemical oxidants and organics are toxic with some beingcarcinogenicepa states that synthetic organic chemicals contribute of the total hydrocarbon emissions from stationary sourcesthey state that control hinges primarily on proper plant designand operation that will require a depth of knowledge by epa ofour operations that is unprecedentedwe have set up a taskgroup to handle this and to coordinate with socma a total ofabout  chemicals will be studied a first meeting of ourtask group with epa was held on january  almost immediatelythe orderly procession of this program was upset to

it may not have reached your ears i am sure your peopleare fuming over it because it is comprehensivewe have never attempted anything to this depth before but then weve never faced billion in investment cost for control of a single class ofpollution beforei use these cost figures with some confidencebecause my own company last year in a similar type study estimatedan investment cost of  million to retrofit existing hydrocarbon sources if the toughest projected pollution control regulations were adoptedin many cases this study is going to bean eye opener and hopefully haye valuable

because chemicals may be dangerous when misused overusedor mishandled and because incidents resulting from such abusesgreatly concern the publicmedia attention and public concern in fact are intense andpgrowing and show no signs of abatingthis is in spite of the factthat the chemical industry as a whole has had an excellent recordin handling hazardous chemicals on a daily basis without harm tothe public or the environmentiigovernmental and congressional attention is just as intense andofficial bodies have proposed many solutions to problems arising fromchemical incidentsthey have done so however in a piecemeal anduncoordinated mannerin their various forms these solutions call for the transferof resources to provide the following penalties for spills restitution for individuals personally or economically harmed remedies or neutralization of the effects of chemicalmishaps and restoration of damaged sites and conditionsthe adjournment of the th congress on october  has nothalted attempts by the legislative and executive branches to deviseremedies for incidents related to overuse misuse or improper disposal of chemicals the house commerce subcommittee on oversight

abandoned waste disposal sites which pose athreat to the environmentit appears that the fund concept developed in the th congress  first for oil and then chemicalspills  will reappear in new

learned that the treasury department is consideringa modification of the domestic international sales corporationdisc provisions of the internal revenue code this considerationhas arisen because of allegations by european common market membersthat the disc provision violates the gatt subsidies codeunder present law the disc provisions permit a corporationto defer current us income taxation on up to onehalf of itsexport profits so long as those profits are devoted to exportrelated activitiesin  the latest year for which officialtreasury department figures are available the chemical andallied products industries deferred  million in taxes fromdisc sales or  percent of total gross receipts at issuehowever is not only the value of the current tax incentive fordisc related activities but the tax treatment of previouslydeferred disc incomesince the disc provisions were enacted in total tax deferrals could be substantial for many cmamember companiesat the september meeting cmas board of directors expressedits concern over developments related to disc and directed the taxpolicy committee to review this problem and to develop an appropriatecma response and strategy on october   the foreign taxtask group met on disc and a representative will present a statusreport to the board at its november meetingin the interim cmapresident robert a roland has written directly to treasurysecretary donald t regan to stress the prime importance of discto the chemical industry and cmas desire to be consulted in thedevelopment of this legislationaction requirednonefor information onlycmacma exhibit creport on discreport of the tax policycommittee on disccma enthusiastically applauds the decision of the reagan administrationto continue its support of the provisions of the internal revenue code whichpertain to domestic international sales corporations discfor some time the treasury department and the office of the specialtrade representative had considered proposals to modify the disc provisionsthis review stemmed from allegations of our major european trading partnersthat those provisions violate the gatt subsidies codeit is understood that the gatt council may make a final decision in thenear future on whether disc violates gatt it is possible that such a decisioncould be delayed for an  month period cma is most encouraged that theadministration will vigorously defend the disc provisions however if it isultimately decided that disc violates gatt the united states will be facedwith repealing or replacing oisc or retaining disc and allowing gatt membersto impose countervailing duties and to take trade reprisals this would probably result in gatt becoming a weakened international organizationthe disc issue is very important to the economics of the us chemicalindustry export sales comprise a significant portion of total industry salesand export profits are likewise significant the elimination of the discprovisions would substantially affect the ability of the us chemical industryto compete in international markets moreover if disc were eliminated andaccumulated earnings were made subject to tax chemical companies would seea substantial plunge in available capital and earnings reported to shareholdersin that year because of payment of the tax or an increase in tax reservesit is possible that disc could be replaced by a different export incentivesuch as a foreign international sales company regardless of what is proposedongoing industry effort will be required to ensure that any disc replacementis at least as beneficial as disc the key questions that must be consideredin this regard are the treatment of existing tax deferrals and intercompanypricing rulesin view of these considerations the tax policy committee recommends thatcma take the following positions with respect to disccma supports disc as the minimum response of the usgovernment to an effective export policy cma andcma member companies should urge secretary regan ambassadorrock and other representatives of the government not toconcede that oisc might violate gatt european countriesshould be made to understand that the united states believesthat disc is not as strong an export incentive as the effectof the tax systems of those countries and that the unitedstates is committed to and will provide an incentive noless strong than disccma should however direct its tax policy committee tostudy develop and pursue alternative export incentivesso that cma could respond imnediately with an acceptablealternative to any action of gatt the treasury or thecongress that might lead to a likely repeal of discin its activities the tax policy conmlttee believes itshould pursue three fundamental principles first anyalternative export incentive shall be at least as beneficialto exports on an overall basis as the present disc provisionssecond any alternative export incentive must containclear and equitable principles for the pricing of exportsalong the lines of section  of the disc rules thirdthere should be no tax imposed as part of any changeoverto an alternative entity on present accumulated discearnings more than  billion in current us

beattychairman energy committeeaugust  good morning my energy committee report is a bit like a good news bad newsstory the good news has already happened in the year just completed the badnews is waiting to happen in  and it may if we relax our efforts duringthe current yearlast year i optimistically titled ay report new horizons anticipating thatwe had reached a major turning point in federal energy policy that ve couldcorrect the excesses of the past and in particular the overregulation of thecarter years and the five part national energy act of  that we couldmove from supply regulation and demand restriction to supply stimulationthrough free market pricing knowing that further gains in energy conservationand fuel switching and most importantly market stability and predictabilitywould follow that optimism was based on the election of ronald raagan withhis free market energy platform it is useful to review two parts of theenergy plank of the  bepublican platformin order to increase domestic production of energy republicanswe advocate the decontrol of the price at the wellhead of oil andgaswe also believe that market restrictions on the use ofnatural gas should be eliminatedrepublicans we understand that a free market based on thecollective priorities and judgments of individual consumers willefficiently allocate the energy supplies to their most highly valuedusersthe president has delivered on many of his energy pledges the energycommittee likes to think that ve have helped over the past yearlast year we identified two major items for our energy agendanatural gas deregulation andelimination of inequitable federal allocation schemes for thedistribution of crude oil under the emergency preparedness allocation actfor emergency preparedness we prepared recommendations and testified beforecongress and lobbied for no bill to replace the expired epaa while theseefforts didnt convince congress that a bill was not necessary we believethey did help to reinforce president reagans resolve that no bill wasneeded although congress passed the standby petroleum allocation act thepresident vetoed that bill and in a remarkable turnaround the senate sustainedthe veto after passing the spaa by a vote of  to i also reported significant reductions in the regulatory burden of the powerplant and industrial fuel use act and this year i can again report evenfurther gains these regulations were one of those identified for vicepresident bushs regulatory reform task forcecwa in march president reagan ended any chance of congressional action on thederegulation of natural gas when he announced that he would not seeklegislation in  while consumer activists and other opponents ofderegulation hailed the presidents announcement as a major victory mostobservers recognized it as a postponement not a solution to the problems ofthe natural gas policy act and the public debate has continuedthe energy committee recognized that the debate particularly as reported bythe press was not going in ourdirection the exaggerated claims of theconsumer activists and other opponents of decontrol were consistently gainingheadlines while more rational analyses were being ignored the energycommittee commissioned foster associates a nationally recognized natural gasauthority and consultant to compare and analyze ten recent studies of naturalgas deregulation that varied widely in their findings on the impact ofdecontrol as you would suspect the conclusions of each study supported theviews of the authorsfoster found two studies decidedly more comprehensive and realisticassessments of total phased decontrol these were by the department of energyand standard oil of indianaconversely foster found three studies predicted exaggerated andunsupportable field price projections and hence contributed little to aconstructive analysis of the decontrol issue in march we held a pressconference to release the foster study and we followed that with acongressional staff briefing both events were well attended just lastmonth representative dannemeyer from california quoted from our study in thecurrent hearings before the house fossil and synthetic fuels subcommitteein  our energy conservation resumed its upward progress by climbing to z better than  this is particularly encouraging in light ofthe stagnant economy our voluntary goal of z appears well within reachit is also of interest to examine how our raw energy consumption has changedsince  this table reflects raw energy usage as reported hy our membercompanies it has not been corrected for production changes significantreductions have been made in fuel oil and natural gas consumptionsurprisingly coal use is actually down slightly and electricity is upsubstantiallyim afraidthe answer is washington this is the bad news last year we had two majorissues this year we have threenatural gas decontrol continuesemergency preparedness is in a state of remission andthe newcomer is of course energy taxescma i goals and objectiveslets examine our plans and goals for each of che major issuesfirst natural gas deregulationthe chemical industry consumes over twotrillion cubic feet of natural gas annually which is more than  of thetotal united states consumption and about  of the us industrial use is our last chance for legislation to be enacted to replace the ngpabefore its partial decontrol occurs on january   the administrationand congress will be reluctant to address natural gas in  a presidentialelection year furthermore our worst case risk is no longer just noaction it is an extended ngfa our basic position on deregulation is thatche ngpa be amended to provide forsmooch and predictable phase up of all natural gas wellhead ceilingprices to market clearing levelsfree market access for all consumers pipelines and distributors to alltypes of natural gas suppliesa coordinated removal of supply and demand restraints including therepeal of the industrial sections of the fuel use act and incrementalpricingin order to make significant progress over the coming months in thederegulation debate we must address in detail four areas of controversyfirstthe timing of old gas decontrol the interstate pipelinesdistribution companies and some predominantly interstate consumers arereluctant to give up natural gas access and bidding advantages that they haveunder the ngfa many are willing to decontrol old gas but not simultaneouslywith new gassecondis the problem of producerpipeline contracts the interstatepipelines are quite concerned about imprudent contracts that they have signedparticularly after the ngpa was enacted that contain price escalatorclauses in theory these clauses upon decontrol would increase the price ofgas paid by these pipelines beyond market clearing levels the pipelines wantlegislated protection to prevent this possibilitythirdis a windfall profits tax such a tax is a distinct politicalpossibility as a compromise to consumer activist interests and as a source ofadded federal revenue which may be particularly enticing to a congress facingcontinued hugh budget deficits we are concerned that full decontrol with anexcessive windfall profits tax could well be worse than the ngpacma fourthl th severity of price fly up upon deregulation most peoplesviews on total decontrol of natural gas are directly related to theirperception of the magnitude of the price increase that will result theconsumer activists have effectively convinced the public that decontrol willdevastatetheir personal budgets the press continues to provide front pagecoverage to these claims while more moderate projections by more knowledgeableparties are deemed not newsworthymost important of all in our effort to obtain deregulation of natural gas isstrong support by president reagan we will urge the administration tointroduce a deregulation bill early in  or to endorse a bill introduced bya proponent of decontrol our committees action plan includesanalyze the national supplydemand outlook for the nation and thechemical industry beyond continue to present the

and economically damaging through theincrease it would cause to the international balance of trade deficit inletters that we sent to senator wallop and representative sharp we opposed allenergy tax proposals and offered total phased deregulation of natural gas asan alternate which would increase federal revenues within the existing taxstructure many observers rate the possibility of an energy tax high for the tax possibilities are shown on this slide our analysis of the variousalternate which is still in development ranks them from least impact togreatest impact for a given federal revenue gain as follows an increasedexcise tax on gasoline a btu excise tax an ad valorum tax and finally animported and domestic crude oil or refinery tax for perspective the directgst to the chemical industry of a lod per gallon gasoline tax increase wouldbe quite modest at just a few million dollars annually that tax would raise b conversely a  per barrel fee on imported and domestic crude

particularly the more burdensome energytaxes analyze the effects of a windfall profits excise tax on natural gaswith total phased deregulation of gas develop coalitions to continue tooppose burdensome energy taxes and develop feedstock exemption languageshould an energy tax become inevitablethere are secondary issues that we will also address during this year whilethe fuel use act regulations have been reduced dramatically they stillexist we will continue to follow with particular interest the cogenerationexemption and related activity in the federal energy regulatory commission andthe litigation in the courts on full avoided cost sale of electric power byindustrial cogenerators to utilities and interconnection with utilitiesalso we will be evaluating the administrations proposal to

exciting and underdeveloped sounds like adescription of parts of the napa valleybut like the valleyit has its pitfalls fortunately we have good guides  ourprocess control task groupon may  and  the tsk group conducted its thirdprocess computer users forum half a day was devoted todistributed control systems unique to this session werepresentations by noncompany member people a professor anda journal editorthis was followed by discussions of humancontrol systemprocess interface retrofit of existing plants and integratedcontrol systemsintegrated control systems are those which combine distributed regulatory control systems and managementinformation systemswe have heard the term distributed control systems forthe last several yearsit you are like me you had an ideaof what was meant but were a little vaguein a simplified distributed system there is somethingto be controlled for instance a valve a signal is sentthis indicates the current conditionit is received by thecontroller where it is analyzed and if necessary correctiveaction is taken to open close or adjust the valve earlyanalog devices were elementary by todays digital standardsthe modern controller is much smarterhowever it neither sees all nor knows allsome jobsare too complicated for it to handle a higher capacitycentral process computer will monitor many parameters as wellas signals to and from the controllersit can make far morecomplex calculations considering input from many sourcescma it can tell the controller what action to take and may evenreprogram it to react properly to changed conditions equallyimportant the main computer can be equipped with a voluminousand reliable long term memoryit can store process data thenin case of an upset it can retrieve and analyze the data toisolate the causein an integrated system the informationis also available to business computers to process managementinformationfortunately for us humans even the central computerneeds to be monitored and occasionally correctedso thereare still operators but they are operating with far morepowerful tools than available beforethe term distributed is used to describe the distributionof functions to individual controllers versus control directlyby a central unitthese systems are not only cost effective they lookgood toothe last half day of the forum was devoted to opendiscussion and

to call your attention to the written report previously distributed to you particularly section v    committee objectivesand progress section vi keymens report on the substantive issues andsection vii major legislative issues timetables and priorities as i willnot cover these matters in my presentationlast year we reported on the implications of the political changesbrought about by the election of president reagan and a republican senateand how these changes might impact on the chemical industry effect the roleof the grc and our legislative efforts we mentioned that the economicissues taxes budget cuts and social security reform would dominate thetime and attention of both the administration and congress and that we didnot expect major environmental or health legislation to pass in  inaddition we stated that these issues would be put off until  bringingthem into consideration during an election year thus making it even moredifficult to achieve substantial amendments we also stated that this didnot mean that efforts should not be made to amend key legislation but wehad to be realistic about our chances for success we pointed out thatsignificant legislation might be set aside and no final action taken untilthis now appears to be the casewe are greatly disappointed that the seemingly favorable politicalmakeup of the administration and congress did not produce results butwhat has happened was not totally unexpectedhowever we are continuing to work for comprehensive changes in anumber of laws and the organizational objectives we achieved last yearplace us in a much stronger position to advocate change than in the pastby a more systematic focus on strategy and planning improving communicationsand coordination within the cma structure and continuing efforts to educatemembers of congress and administration officials with wellreasoned positionsand good backup data positions on the issues have been changing for thebetterit is against this background that the grc critiqued its activities anddeveloped our objectives for the coming year the major question we askedourselves was how can we do better and what are the things we have to do tobe bettercma we examined the various factors that impact upon the legislativeprocess and the roles various institutions play in influencing that processthe media public understanding of the chemicalindustry and media influence on congressbusiness coalitions in washingtoncma the grc itself washington representativesand the industrythe chemical industry and its political cloutchemical industry issues and prioritiesi would like to cover just two of those factorsfirst one of the essential ingredients in setting the scene forachieving legislative success is communications why is it when ourindustry advocates changes in legislation that the public perceives itas an attempt to gut a law that protects them and the environment and thatour sole reason for wanting change is cost why does this misconceptioncarry over to the congress which gives us sympathy and understanding butout of fear of public opinion will not vote to support responsible changesthat are well justified on the merits and by good science the mainreason is the single message persistently carried by the media influencedby environmental groups that industryadvocated changes gut the law andthat industry wants change only to save money this oversimplified easytostate message substantiated by a few isolated examples from the pastbut presented as a generalization has created a total misconception ofthe chemical industryto accomplish our industrys legislative goals the grc feels it isessential that we take the necessary actions to clear up these misconceptions by better coordination of our communications program with ourlegislative goalswe will identify those issues of importance prioritize them setgoals and timetables assist in developing communications that are effective in the legislative arena and create a new sense of direction andurgencythe grc will take action jointly with the conmunications committeeto deal with the issues we have voted to form a task group on legislativecommunications to oversee these activities and through this grouptarget communicationsrelated projectsthe second essential ingredient is what we referred to in our reportas us the chemical industry has considerable political clout if youwant to call it that but we are not sure that this clout is being usedin the most effective way this is a sensitive area and one we are hescma cant to discuss because it could be misinterpreted as interfering withthis is not the case we are all in the sameboat on these issues even though legislation may impact differently onindividual companies we are all affected by the passage of legislationthat calls for further regulation of our industryso we either sink orswim together what we will be trying to do is prudently direct andutilize this clout to accomplish our legislative objectivesinternal company businesswe plan a number of actions to gather information on just wherethe industry stands and the details of these activities are spelled outin section viii of our report we will need your personal commitment andsupport in this effortanother sensitive area i would like to mention is ceo involvement inthis process there are times where certain highlevel contacts must bemade within the administration or with the congressional leadershipsome cases this already has been done it is our opinion that we canonly achieve credibility at that level by representation from the topthe hired guns can go only so farthen the system calls for bringing inthe big guns on specific issues where an appropriate relationship existsthis involvement will be requested through the proper cma channels andhere again we ask you commitmentwe believe the committee plans and objectives for  and  of improving communications working in coalitions and focusing on influenceenergetically pursued will go a long way toward enhancing our chances ofachieving our legislative goalsa look at the futuretas far as the executive branch is concerned we are being listenedto and we have not been faced with a flow of new regulations deregulationhas not produced the changes we had hoped for but there has been improvementthis takes time the reform movement has lost some momentum as efa andto a lesser degree osha have baen under political attack this is apparentin legislation being considered by congress in that a number of amendmentsto various laws are designed to force epa into taking action or handcuffingthem where they have used their discretion on issues the environmentalistshold dearaction by the administration in lobbying for changes in environmentallegislation is invisible the white house is keenly aware that publicopinion holds little sympathy for amendments to environmental health andsafety laws and is keeping a low profile on the issuethe bottom line is that we cannot expect too much executive branchsupport on environmental legislation at this time also we should bealert to the signals that the white house is concerned about its image oncma environmental issues and in order to neutralize this issue we can expectsome administrative action regulatory to show their concern for thoseissuesas far as congress is concerned the votes in the house on fifra andclean air in the house and senate causes great concern many months ofwork with the congressional committees in hammering out compromises haveeasily gone down to defeat on the floor of congress because of the emotionaland political climate that exists todaywhat we are seeing today is a number of battles in a war where theoutcome is still in doubtat this stage we do not expect any major environmental legislation topass this session of congresslook at forecast on specific issues insection vi this forecast could change as the politics of the issues areso complex it is difficult to give a precise reading however there willbe little time to deal with these issues between the time congress returnsseptember  and adjourns the first week in october we are continuing towork for comprehensive and constructive changes in the laws being consideredand this pressure is having the effect of extending the debatewhat about    we believe most of these issues will beaddressed in  what will be the political situation at that time theoutcome of the  elections will determine the character of the nextcongress there are as many opinions on what the character might be as thereare people who make predictions we arent qualified to predict but someexperts do not feel the change will be all that significant republicans arepredicted to maintain control of the senate and will not loose a significantnumber of seats in the housea key factor in    impacting on legislation will be the shapeof the economy and the jobs issue since  is a presidential election yearwhat takes place in  will determine the issues of the  election andwhat congress and the administration believes to be public opinion will biasconsideration of environmental health and safety legislation this is oneof the reasons we believe our communications efforts are crucialwe cannot be sure of the answers to those questions at this time wecan only be sure that under any set of political circumstances our goals willnot be easy to attain we are confident that the approach we have developedto deal with these issues will serve us well under any circumstances and inthe long haul lead to successwe will not be disappointed if legislation is not passed during thiscongress because in most cases what is being considered is worse thanor little better than what now exists to say that the situation willonly get worse next year could be interpreted as meaning we do not havemuch confidence in our positions and we should not accept thatcmacma iexhibit dexecutive summaryof theenvironmental management committee

clean air media tours in  citiesocma has been extensively involved in discussions with epa and otherconcerned parties over epas implementing regulations for subpartc of rcra concerning hazardous wastes over the past year the emcsefforts have begun to bear fruit epa now recognizes the chemicalindustrys concern that the regulatory system not be a disincentiveto internal reuse and recycling of wastes and will revise its definition of solid waste to essentially exclude such wastes from thehazardous waste system and epa has revised the mixture rule byredefining which wastewater streams are hazardous thereby removing chemical industry surface impoundments from the systemindustrys approach will result in effective reduction in hazardouswaste and more effective use of byproducts in waste streamscma research and consultingth total fy  budget for emc research and consulting projects was actual expenditures totaled  and are detailed on pages  through the research and consulting budget for fy  is program outlookalthough it might seem that there should be a trend toward decreasing activityin the environmental arena this is not the case epa staff are slowlyadopting some of the messages espoused by top agency administrators ourcontinued input to epa is required to guarantee progress during this timethat is generally viewed as store cooperative than adversarial all levels atthe agency are requesting industry input to their prograsts a positiveresponse by industry will require even store stember company and staff resourcesthan in the past our continued regulatory efforts can result in more costeffective regulations for industry that can also result in a substantiallyimproved environmentthe emc will be challenged during the next year to respond to the epa and toadequately support legislative and judicial issues as they arise we willneed resources to respond to possible amendments to the clean air act cleanwater act resource conservation and recovery act and the safe drinkingwater act there may be litigation related to the comprehensive environmentalresponse compensation and liability act superfund and many familiarenvironmental issues will become important at the state level we will therefore be in a continuous process of setting priorities and concentrating ourresources where they will have the greatest likelihood of positive impact onthe industrycmaiiicma rexhibit dsupplem ntremarks to cma board of directorsby will d carpenterchairman environmental management committeeaugust  earlier this year in a conversation with the chairman of the boardi consented that in the environmental arena a perfect score is zero and food score is a small negative number its probably not that bad butvc aust run hard to stay in the same placethe environmental management committee has several key messages tobring to the board and x appreciate this opportunity to address theenvironmental issues that impact the chemical industrylast year tyne jaeschke the emc chairman made several observations about theyear ahead to this group  the year we have justcompleted his remarks are a useful point of departureemc identified nine issues we felt would require the major part ofour resources those issues included of course the caa legislativereport the water permits program and related water regulation weresecond followed by rcba and superfund issues ve then listed severalcrosscutting issues common to all or several of the above regulatoryreform good science economic consideration of regulation and the stateissues were the major crosscutting issues in retrospect the emcmembers and cma staffers can be pleased with their crystal ball with hindsight we dont need to change one the next part of mypresentation is to answer the obvious questionif you were so smartabout predicting the issues what did you do about themfirst let me say that the emc was adequately resourced by theb ard we had good support from the member companies and the staffdelivered for us time and time again we managed our resources wellour outside expenditures were  of budget  was expended asplanned the remainder was shifted to more urgent higher priorityprojects that surfaced during the year as we constantly monitored ourresources to ensure maximum effectivenessthere were a number of accomplishments that are worthwhile discussingve selected six that are among the most significant as one analyzes theseresults we can very nicely use them to give you a better insight into howemc does its work in addition to the type of results obtainedtof the six results reported here two have to do with water onevitb air and three with solid waste  one rcra and two superfundcma national pollutant discharge elimination system regulations npdeswater permitsafter three years of extensive negotiations cma epa and otherparties have concluded a settlement agreement on  of  issues raisedas part of litigation challenging the npdes implementing regulationsthe settlement agreement is highly favorable to industry the key pointsare as followspermit application requirements have been reducedthere is a substantial increase in flexibility for calculating morefavorable numerical permit limitations which should result inreduced treatment costsprocedures for challenging permit conditions will be morereasonable this should reduce the cost and manpower needed tosecure acceptable final permit conditions anddischargers will have increased flexibility in avoiding noncompliance penalties when violations occur as a result ofinadvertent or unknown circumstancesfourteen of the reauining issues have been set aside for litigationlater during appropriate permitting cases as a result the actualnumber of issues to be briefed with the court of appeals has been limitedto a reasonable number thereby achieving our secondary objective ofreducing cost of managing the issuecmaepa fiveplant studyover the last year and a half cma and epa jointly managed a cooperative fiveplant study to ascertain the removal efficiency of toxicorganic pollutants by existing chemical industry biological treatantfacilities in a recent cma consultants report on the study it wasfound that current inplant biological treatment is doing an excellentjob in removing toxic organic pollutants from cheatical waste watersover  percent removal of toxics was achieved the study provides epawith the best longterm data on the removal efficiency of biologicaltreatment for toxic organics and should play a key role in epas development of effluent guidelines for the organic plastic and syntheticchemical industry we hope epa will use this data to conclude that noadditional technology beyond current welldesigned and operated biologicaltreatment is needed to define bat best available control technologyeconomically achievable much of our effort this next year will bedevoted to this taskclean air act amendmentsas you all know a lot of emcs effort over the last two and a halfyears has been directed at clean air act amendments with the governmentrelations committee we have been pursuing a strategy to obtain relieffr m current bureaucratic constraints in the act and to obtain morecosteffective clean air programscma many of the reforms we are seeking have been adopted at one time oranother by the house committee these include better psd and nonattainmentprogram and streamlined sip procedures it is important that we get a billthrough with these improvements at the same time there are problemsprincipally in the hazardous air pollutants area the antiindustry coalitionbss demonstrated far greater impact than industry or the administration hadanticipated it is clear that this part of the act will be changed wheneveramendments are passed ve are working hard now to make sure these changesinclude needed improvements while protecting our industrys interestsrcra implementing regulationscma over the past several years has been extensively involved indiscussions with epa and other concerned parties over epas implementingregulations for subpart c of rcra concerning hazardous wastes severalof the discussions were in fact settlement negotiations of outstandingjudicial challenges to the prior administrations implementing regulationsthat were technically incorrect or that imposed inappropriately stringentrequirements that offered no commensurate environmental benefits overthe past year the emcs efforts have begun to bear some significant fruitsone example is epas recognition of the chemical industrys number oneconcern that the present regulatory system inappropriately created a disincentive for the chemical industry to internally reuse and recycle wastesepa is now finalizing a proposed revision of its definition of solid wastethat will rectify this concern by essentially excluding industry internalreuse and recycling of wastes from the hazardous waste system a secondexample is the agencys revision of the mixture rule by redefining whichwastewater streamsare hazardous this modification removes  chemicalindustry surface impoundments from the hazardous waste system  of whichwould probably have needed replacementhazardous waste site management planpursuant to directions from the board that the hazardous wasteresponse center direct its efforts to assistance for member companies indisposal site cleanup the task group has managed the preparation andpublication this spring of the definitive work on waste site sunagemententitled a hazardous waste site management plan the document hasbeen designed to aid in the development of site management plans forclean up of sites and to assist in mitigating any potential or actualadverse environmental effects the site management plan is being used bymember companies and federal and state agencies as a critical managementtool in resolving health andor environmental problems created by hazardouswastes in inactive disposal sitessuperfund implementationas you are all well aware superfund and its implementation is anexceedingly high priority issue for the emc and the chemical industrythe resource commitment we have made to date in order to obtain areasonable implementation of superfund has definitely been a costeffective decision in this regard epa has just recently promulgatedcma the final revisions to the national contingency plan these are consistent vith the positions that cma has advocated on this natter thekey points areno dtal standard for cleanup between fund financed versus privatelyfinanced cleanupfund financed cleanups should generally be tied to the priority listof sites anda flexible standard as to how clean a site would have to be under asuperfund cleanup initiativealthough several significant issues still remain to be addressedie mining site cleanup funding state superfund preenption tort lawand waste end studies the industry advocacy effort has resulted thusfar in aore reasonable iapleaentation by epa than first indicatedafter this brief description of six key issues  would like to usea few slides to give you an insight into the aanageaent of issues by theemc ve will focus on areas qf impact resources and resultsin each slide the issues are listed on the left in the firstslide the area of impact is indicated on the right the areas listedare obvious however it is of interest that the emc with cma staffmoves effectively across these four areas with a large number of issuesas you can see from the slide frequently our efforts have impact inmore than one of these fourin the next slide the same six issues are listed again to show thekey resources used for each of the six of course cma staff is involvedin every action but the comparative effort varies from issue to issuein the final two slides we focus on the bottom line justificationsare arbitrarily broken into four listings once again we can win inmore than one way as an aside we must improve on expressing ouractions in terms of positive impact on the environment for instancethe plant study shows that procedures already in place have reducedpollutants in water by hundreds of thousands of tons over that expectedby epa the industry and the administration are interested in costeffective regulation  as well we should but the public wants to hearwhat happens to the environment ve must provide that information forour own interest and learn to do it routinely  in our formal commentson legislation and regulation in our casual discussions with the influencepeople as well as our chemcap programnow let us look ahead using the previous format i will discussthe legislative area first in the coming year we can expect amendmentsto rcra and the cva which are already underway before the next annualreport the legislative effort on cescla will be underway vith the caastill uncertaincma with the makeup and mood of congress presently and in the nextyear we anticipate ve will be swinging upstream given the other optionof sinking however we shall continue to paddle like hell with goodtechnical support and policy guidance through emc we expect to reach ourgoal of costeffective environmentally responsible regulationsthe regulatory arena will be active for virtually every majorenvironmental law as wayne jaeschke reported last year it wasdemonstrated that it takes more effort and resources to participate in acooperative regulatory atmosphere than it does to object in the hostileenvironment that existed two years ago now is our chance to be part ofthe solutionthe emc thinks there are several watchouts during the coming yearsome are issuerelated  others are crosscutting let me list some ofthosegroundwaterits hard to predict when a groundwater incident will beused against industry the way pcbs love canal and others did tocatalyze tsca and superfunda crosscutting issue is emc members impression of disturbingcongressional attitudes on a key subject the banner of good laws andregulations based on good science does not have the isipact on congressthat it once did some members of congress are claiming that this ismerely an excuse to delay implementation of regulations although thegovernment relations group is responsible for our congressional arenathe emc bases its efforts on the underlying principle of good sciencewe must meet this challenge successfullyin addition to the federal issues state issues will demand effortfrom emc members with superfund and disposal sites being major examplesnational ambient air quality standards naaqsozone revisited for ssuperfund implementationwill be a continuing area of effort someimportant issues will be in litigation including litigation in which cmamay participate many cleanups will be underway and some completeddata will need to be compiled for future efforts to sunset the fund assistance to state groups on state legislation  tort lawwith a substantially reduced budget we must select our prioritiescarefully and review our progress and needs to determine

phillips petroleum companyinternational trade issues continue to be an area of high activityas reported before the current recession has promoted various types of protectionisms all around the world the gatt ministerial meeting to be held innovember will be extremely important for setting the direction of internationaltrade in the s a prime item on the u s agenda for that meeting is toobtain a recommitment to free trade as well as to complete certain items leftover from the tokyo round in addition it is planned that the gatt agreementsbe expanded into services such as banking insurance engineering and construction plus an investment code and expansion and redefinition of thegeneralizations system of preferences trade relations with europe are notat their healthiest state in view of the us sanctions regarding the sovietgas pipeline and the countervailing duty decision regarding steel importsinto the united states from europe on the other hand the gatt ministerialcould not come at a more appropriate time from the standpoint of trying tohead off conditions which could escalate into trade retaliation and a reenactment of the smoothawley bill of the s which magnified and prolongedthe great depression there are just a few items i would like to touch on today which are covered generally in your briefing book some of which deservesome expansion the petrochemical discussions there have been no moredevelopments in regard to further discussions with the eec althoughthere continues to be some antidumping activities the europeanchemical industry appears to be more preoccupied with internal conditions in seeking means of rationalizing the significant overcapacitythat exists there has been considerable activity regarding preparations for talks with mexico including direct governmenttogovernmenttn setting the stage plus two meetings with the department of commerceby the panel of advisors from a number of cma member companies theadvisors that your and other cma companies have made available are indeed knowledgeable and experienced and are making significant contributions the greatest challenge at this time is to define objectivesand reach a consensus on objectives among the advisors and with thedepartment of commerce work is proceeding along these lines and theinternational trade committee of the cma is actively pursuing thisthe first meeting with the government of mexico has been scheduled forsometime in october however i made a trip to mexico recently and thetask force of the international trade committee has considered thematter and we are recommending to the department of commerce that thecma october meeting be deferred until sometime after the first ofdecember when the new government of mexico takes office it is notfelt that meetings prior to that time would be productive thepresent chaotic economic conditions in mexico are also a factor inthis recommendationthere have been no meetings held with japan although we continue to hear that a meeting will be requested by them it is alsopossible that sometime in the near future we will get a similar request from canada competitive assessment studies are being conducted by theinternational trade commission and independently by the department ofcommerce regarding the u s petrochemical industry the purpose ofthese studies is to attempt to assess the impact of actions and policies by other governments on the competitiveness of the u s chemicalindustry and are significant to us in that they will no doubt form thebasis for the attitude of the u s government regarding our petrochemical industry in trade negotiations in the future a number of companieshave been asked for inputinto these studies and we will hopefully beable to see early drafts in order that inaccuracies and misunderstandings are not promulgated a very significant item which is coming from various directions including the industry policy advisory committee as well asthrough other channels is the dangerous and insidious vredeling proposalbeing considered in the eec governmental system while most of you maybe familiar with the vredeling proposal i find that some are not so iwould like to describe it briefly this proposal would be a directiveregarding workers rights in the community which extends from ec practiceof local information exchange and consultation to the world stage itwould require annual disclosure of information by management to employeerepresentatives and prior consultation with labor representatives covering major corporate worldwide activities and decisions including mergersshifts in production plant closings and even introduction of new technology into existing plants this directive is for companies employingat least  employees in ec countries it would require that each yearthe parent  s company would submit information to the management ofits ec subsidiaries which would in turn provide it to the local unionlabor representatives covering the parent companys worldwide activitiesrelated to its economic and financial situation the possible development of the business products and sales it would include productionand investment programs manufacturing and working methods includingnew working methods technological innovations and health and safetythe subsidiaries would be required to consult with the employee representatives at least  days prior to any corporate decision which islikely to have a substantial affect on the employees interest with aview to reaching agreement on the measure planned the company must postpone any decision until the union opinion is received or until the dayperiod has elapsed in addition employees at any other subsidiary thanthe one directly affected may also demand tobe consulted the proposedcma idirective also contains provisions under which the employee representative is authorized to open consultation with the parent company management under a bypass provision the employee representative will begranted appeal rights to tribunal or other national authorities in theevent a management fails to fulfill the provisions of the directivethis of course has numerous drawbacks which include an extraterritorialreach giving unions the ability to negotiate with multinational companies on global corporate plans and at the corporate rather than theindividual plant level it could involve submission of data which may bein violation of securities law and sec regulations access to corporateconfidential or proprietary information and establishing a precedentguaranteeing worker consultation on an international basisthis directive is now before the european parliament for a votethe week of september  the ec commission are to reconsider and probably redraft the directive for consideration by the ec council of ministersin mid to late  if adopted the individual member states would berequired to implement the directive through national legislationthis directive has become highly political and represents a majorpriority for the european trade confederation which has effectively lobbied for it business lobbying on vredeling in the u s is coordinatedthrough the national foreigh trade council the u s council for international business the  s chamber of commerce and the nam initiallythe lobbying took the form that this proposal is so bad that it shouldsimply be discarded present wisdom is that since some form of vredelingwill be adopted lobbying should take the form of attempting to revise theproposal to something that can be lived with ivor richard of greatbritain is the commission member who will be in charge of the redraftingand is the guru of the vredeling proposal having inherited this role fromvredeling upon the latters retirement richard has indicated in speechesand other discussions that he is flexible as to the final format the present time the cma position regarding vredeling is beingformulated and should be forthcoming in the near future however in themeantime i would urge you to become more familiar with this proposal andits potentially harmful effectscmacma exhibit iinternational tradepetrochemical discussionsthe state of the

directorschairman occupational safety and health committeejanuary  during the years  and  and  under the leadership of tomevans the osh committee of cma was reorganized reenergized and becamerecognized by government agencies as a force for industry representationand cooperative effort with this as a foundation we decided to look at thetasks for the year  he decided that initially we should reevaluatethe current osha administrations attitude establish cooperative nonduplicative efforts with other interindustry groups establish strong communications with other cma committees whose work overlapped and influenced ours andconsolidate andor eliminate task groups where feasiblethe attitude of the current osha administration was succinctly made clearto us by a communication which we received from mark cowan the thendeputyassistant secretary for osha he said after years of stating that industryif given the opportunity is well equipped to address workplace problems industrynow in the osha area has an opportunity which may never again be repeated theopportunity exists for corporate america to double and redouble their effortsin this field so as to prove it can be done without undue government interferencethe chance to demonstrate conclusively that companies sincerely care about theirworkforce is available should this opportunity be missed or worse shouldcorporations through a deemphasis of safety and health programs give credenceto the allegation that the only concern in the boardroom is profit the old oshaof days past will rise from the grave with a vengeance now is not the time forcorporations to let down their guard nor to relax measures which have resulted ingains in the safety and health areahe believe that this gives us a clear indication that the current oshaadministration will continue in the vein that they have been and that they areopen for cooperative efforts from industry groupshe are redoubling our efforts to establish closer and more efficient cooperation with a number of industry groups since numbers of our health and safetypeople serve on task forces with diverse organizations were attempting to determinewho should have the lead role in responding to individual osha regulations in aneffort to minimize the time travel and effort required of the members of yourcompany on these various committees the organization deemed most appropriate toprepare the primary response does so the other organizations then adapt the responseto their needshe are in the process of eliminating some task groups and consolidating othersand will reduce the number of task groups from  to  or  in an effort to streamline the work of the osh comittee and again reduce the time and travel requiredby task group members however major efforts will continue in the area ofcarcinogens reproductive hazards respirators targeting health inspectionsindustrial noise performance standards and hazards connunications federal andand state and consunitycma we have been involved with a number of activities with the governmentagencies involved with health and safety matters a major theme which runsthroughout our responses and testimony related to all osha standards andregulations is the theme performance standards we are constantly advisingosha to write their standards with the goals and objectives desired thegeneral processes andor strategy including work practices to reach thegoal and to minimize the specifications in the materials and equipmenta major effort has been carried out by the safety standards group inthis area they have written a model standard for hazardous substances in theworkplace in performance language at the request of the assistant secretaryfor osha they have used this document in a training session for standards writersin an effort to educate them in the writing of performance standards this hasbeen well received by osha and the task group has received a letter of thanksfrom the director of osha for their activity it is our hope that with thistraining effort and interaction with osha the new standards will be writtenin true performance languageanother significant work effort with osha has led to the adoption of thesafety inspection targeting system for routine safety inspections this enablesosha to focus their inspections on highhazard industries where theyll do themost good and enables those of us with good safety records to be free of routinesafety inspectionswork is ongoing to apply a similar methodology for health inspections andrecently two of our members attended an osha workshop where an effort was beingmade to devise such a method the method recommended by the cma members appearsto have been favorably received by other members of industry the unions andthe governmental agencies we shall continue with efforts in this area over thenear futureanother major effort was carried out on the standard for hazards communication this culminated in testimony by a fourmember panel of cma on june  ur work in this area was completed when posthearing comments were filed inseptember  as stated previously were hopeful that a federal standard inthis area will reempt a myriad of state standards which currently exist frombeing enforced and also prevent the writing of standards by states and communitieswhich have not yet done sowe presented the argument that osha has the authority to preempt statesstandards with a federal standard on the basis that a myriad of state standardswill present an undue burden on interstate commercethis brings me to the area of states activities task group which is doingyeoman work to track and respond to an increasing number of state and local initiatives dealing with hazardous substances under worker right to know and communityright to know statutes it is not clear whether the promulgation of a federalhazardous communication standard will supersede the current states statutes butthe minimum we hope to achieve is to reduce the proliferation of further stateand community statutes in this area it is worthy of note that the state ofcalifornia has already announced their position that there is no federal overrideso long as the state statute is as stringent as the federal further althoughthe federal statute may affect worker right to know laws from proliferatingwe are unsure as to what effect it will have on community right to know standardsconsiderable work remains to be done in this area in conjunction with thelegislative affairs committeecma the issue of managing reproductive risk in the workplace deserves somecomment the reproductive risk issue continues to be active with legislatorsand in the news media as you are probably aware a recent court decision in theolin caseupheld the concept that prohibiting a fertile female from working inan evnironment which is harmful to the fetus does not constitute discriminationon the basis of sex but is a legitimate work practice cma has had a leadposition on this issue for some time and the osh committee will be conductinga conference on managing reproductive risk in the workplace on may  and  it will focus on a review of the most recent information in this fieldwith emphasis on how various companies are addressing it attendees will berestricted to cma members from various line and staff disciplinesin the latter half of  conferences will be conducted on worker educatiorfand on process safety analysisin addressing the future the committee determined that it needed a bettermechanism for picking and choosing from the myriad of issues which ones itshould most appropriately address in an effort to do this we determined thatwe would look at the issues presented to us from the viewpoint of the likelihoodof their occurrence and their potential impact on cma member companies issu swill be submitted to the osh committee by the redesigned future issues taskgroup members of the committee and the general membership of cmain conclusion the osh committee recognizes that the problem of workercommunity and product liability which is currently being addressed by theexecutive committee will be a very significant issue for federal and statelegislators for

reasonableprocrams are now in place or have been proposedfor exampleseveral final rules on existing chemicals are considerablyless burdensome then they might have been without cracs efforts negotiated voluntary tasting is a reality the premanufacture notification pmn program is functioning well withmany pmns filed on cmas pmn form and spa has proposed a pmnexemption program for certain chemicals  largely in responseto a cma petitionfuture cma concerns should focus on how the remainingsections of tsca are implementedfor example the chemicalindustry needs to work closely with epa to ensure that theagencys followup programs on new and existing chemicals areimplemented soundlythe next  months will be a momentous period for cracme have received many signals that tsca reauthorisation

directorsby e hamilton hurstchairman chemical regulations advisory committeejanuary  it seems like only a few months ago i had the pleasure of addressing thisgroup to outline the activities of your chemical regulation advisory committeecrac in the interim we have had a busy but a very productive year i ampleased to be here once again to highlight for you what has taken place andto outline our plans for the coming yearin your premeeting books you will find a detailed summary of our activitiesthis has been prepared by the cma staff which has been of great assistance tous throughout the year z will not cover all of the items included in thissummary as i want to spend my time here discussing the major events and ourfuture activitiesthere are a few key events that did take place over the last  months whichdeserve a quick highlight when we talked last the epa had frankly implemented only a portion of what tsca will ultimately be there was much criticism of the agencys failure to implement tsca the events of  havechanged that and a great portion of the proposed rules have been finalizedand put into placereporting requirements of tscaproduction use and exposure data were required on  chemicalsby november health and safety studies were required on  chemicals bydecember testingfor  the court mandated a schedule for epa to respond with adecision to test or not to test  xtcdesignated chemicals theefa has made those decisions in  cases with  others imminentin addition to the court ordered schedule epa has made decisionson  other itcdesignated chemicalschemical controlrules for regulating pcbs in electrical equipment and excludingcma some closed or controlled waste manufacturing systems werefinalized a third pcb regulation scheduled now for december will address all other processes which generate incidentalnew chemicalssome  new chemicals have gone through the pmn process withonly a handful being regulated the spa reports that approximately  of the pmns are of such low risk that they cancomplete this review in about  days only  warrant extensivereview exceeding  days time less than  have resulted ineither spa orders or were withdrawn by the submitter because ofquestions on risks associated with the chemical the agency hasresponded to cmas petition to exempt certain smallvolume chemicals sitelimited intermediates and polymers from full pmnreview based on results of their pmn review experiences epaproposed exemption rules in august  which should finalizeby midyear since the events i have outlined are epa actions and regulations at that youmight reasonably ask  well what has crac done to earn our pay  the epaseems to have done all the work  and what we have gotten are regulationsi can proudly say  we have done a lot cma has had major impact in eachof these areasto our industrys benefitin the reporting areafor production use and exposure data reporting the original epaproposals covered  chemicals  about  times what was coveredin the final rule cma was successful in convincing epa they shouldask only for the amount of data they could reasonably handle anddigest on a current basis we were able to avoid data gatheringfor data gatherings sakethe health and safety datain the finalization of these rules we were successful in reducingthe amount of data to be submitted we were able to shorten thehistorical time period for which each company must review theirrecords and submit datatestingin the testing area production use and test data informationcma input from the individual companies has resulted in a number ofdecisions by the epa to not require testing of itcdesignatedchemicals in other instances companies have been able to usenegotiations to reach agreement with the agency on what testingis most reasonably required crac has promoted the acceptance ofthe negotiated testing concept as a practical substitute forformal test rules under tsca negotiated test agreements saveour resources and result in testing programs which focus only onthe most significant needsnew chemicalsthe experience epa has now achieved from processing  pmnshas allowed us to isolate facts from this data to demonstrate andconvince the epa that exemptions to the pmn system were neededjustified and would help both industry and the agency while theagency would always like to have more information and test datasubmitted on the pmn they have developed review procedures usingpmn information and structural similarity studies with which theyare satisfied they can carry out their responsibilities for pmnreview under tsca it was very refreshing to hear an epa spokesmanat a recent presentation of their pmn system remark  we recognize that the pmn can be a terrible burden on new product innovation there is no way we should expect the development of completetest data on each new chemical at this stage of their developmentnor do we need it to make the assessments required by tsca  hereagain the epa has heard us weve come a long way baby at leastwith tsca the epa is getting practicalwhile we have our successes we still have some major obstacles in front ofus an important priorities for oversight hearings  scheduled for early final pmn rules  scheduled by the second quarterfinal pmn exemption rules  scheduled by the third quarterthe development of epas approach to assign priority to and to regulateexisting chemicalsthese forthcoming events dictate our immediate plans for the future and it willrequire our close attention to solidify our present gains and to continue theimplementation of tsca as a workable lawthe most significant of our future activities is also the one we have to tacklecma first  the oversight hearings while i had a rather uneventful experience of testifying before a senate subcommitte on toxic substances andenvironmental oversight back in august of  the real game will beplayed early this spring perhaps in february or march in both the houseand the senatewe expect the oversight hearings to be particularly tough as our opponentsseek to turn around some of the successes we have achieved specificallyin the house before congressman florios subcommittee we expect to see thefollowing issues to be pushed by the environmentaliststsca should be amended to require testing of new chemicalssince industry is providing test data in less than  ofthe casesthe agency should not be allowed to accept negotiated testingagreements as a substitute for test rules since these agreementsare unenforceablethe ability of the agency to regulate chemicals under tsca isconstrained by the need to balance risks and benefits and makefindings of unreasonable risk this requires that tsca beamended to reduce these constraintsthe environmentalists have indicated they intend to open tsca for amendments and we believe congressman plorio will be willing to listen congressman florio has already commissioned ota office of technology assessment us congress to make a study on the adequacy of data submitted on a pmjin addition he commissioned the gao general accounting office to studyepas pmn review process to include procedural and policy differencesbetween epas and eecs approach the senate has commissioned gao generalaccounting office to study the merits of negotiated testing versus testingrulesso our work is cut out for us within crac we have established an ad hocoversight committee chaired by myself with carl umland of exxon as vicechairman this consul ttee made up of our task group chairman and coordinated with the government relations committee through our key manjerry kinney of onion carbide is preparing position papers on these issuesand others we plan to enlist the help of our friends on the house subcommittee to counter the environmental leanings of congressman florio andothers on the committee we will welcome any and all help we can get aswe enter this oversight activity our objective is to avoid damagingamendments to tscawhile we expect our major confrontation with the environmentalists will bein the house the climate in the senate is also not the most desirablethough the senate subcommittee is controlled by republicans the specificmembers have environmental interests and we will again need to be wellpreparedas part of our preparation for oversight and for use in other public arenaswe are completing our survey on chemical company activity to reduce unreasonable risk this survey which your executive committee approved at ourfall meeting in chicago should provide valuable information for use at thehearings to demonstrate that industry on its own has taken the action neededto reduce unreasonable risks and that the spirit of tsca is workingfurthermore the data should help us indicate that significant changes to thelaw are unnecessarywe have over  companies participating in the survey so we believe theresults will be creditable initial results appear to be following thepattern seen in the pilot survey which we completed early in  thecompanies have sent in their responses and our contractor is tabulating theinformation for us now we expect to have an initial tabulation of theresults by january th for our review of course we will forward a copyof the results of this survey to you prior to announcing it to the publicwe expect we will be ready for public release around february stgetting back to the regulatory side of our operations the agency hasannounced they intend to publish final pmn rules by april  and arepreparing an active followup program for certain new chemicals we havereason to believe the agency has again heard us and will back off fromthe extensive pmn forms originally proposed while we have urged the agencynot to adopt a form we expect they will require one to encourage consistency and organization of the pmn data we will be endeavoring to againprovide impact in the development of the final formwe expect to followup activity will be based upon the implementation ofsignificant new use rules snurs and the various reporting rules forchemicals in commercial production we could see some of these followupprograms early this year we expect these will be used in only a handfulof cases but we are actively working to assure the criteria used to initiatethis activities are acceptablethe pmn exemption proposal put forth by the epa follows for the most partthe concepts offered by cma in its petition where the agency has proposedmore extensive and burdensome approaches we have reacted through commentstestimony and facetofaee discussion to offer alternatives which willachieve the epas and industrys goals we expect final rules on exemptionsby midyear and our new chemial task group now chaired by jerry hapka ofdupont will be working to bring these to fruitioncma the last major regulatory objective under tsca will be the establishmentof proper criteria to select and give priority to those chemicals whichmay become the subject of regulation this is a part of tsca under whichthe agency is still under criticism since there have been no final rulesregulating chemicals under tsca other than pcss which was written intothe act itself the agency is working to develop a process for existingchemicals now zn the past year we established under crac a new task groupchaired by fred hoerger of dow to work with the spa on this process development there are  or  chemicals that spa is now reviewing and we couldexpect one or more of these to be the subject of proposed rules by the endof  or early  controlling some aspects of production processingdistribution use or disposal he believe we are in a position to make thisprocess a reasonable one as it is developedin summary  saw major advances in the implementation of tsca and majorprogress on the part of the epa in making the final rules and proceduresmuch more reasonable crac through its  active members and the excellentcma staff support we have received has been instrumental in achieving thiswe said last year that a window existed with this administration to makesignificant advances in implementing tsca in a reasonstie way we have gottennumber of rules through that window will present new challenges the most critical of which will be ouroversight hearings where we must hold our ground and solidify the gains wehave made we still believe tsca is a workable law when implemented in areasonable and timely fashion we will need to demonstrate that it isworking and that the goals of tsca to reduce unreasonable risk are beingachieved we will not seek to reopen tsca for asiendment however should thisoccur we are prepared to offer our suggested improvementsi have had the pleasure of chairing the crac comittee for the past year and ahalf and will complete this assignment and my fourth year of crac membershipin june i thank you for the support you have given to your committee and tome personally the work of crac was needed crac has been and continues tobe effective in achieving industrys goals to make tsca a workable law as itis implementedcmacma exhibit cexecutive summaryin  cma through the patent and trademark committee patc has beenan instrumental voice in providing industry input to the us government m thedevelopment of its patent policies at home and abroad the patc has alsoadvocated cma positions as appropriate directly with foreign authoritiesduring the past year cma through the patc has obtained increasedvisibility and respect in the industrial property rights area congressionaland agency staff persons solicit cmas comments on pending domestic legislation anticipated regulatory changes and international negotiationscommittee members in addition to preparing written comments for submissionby cma have for example testified before the patent and trademark officeon a proposed rulemaking and have served as industry advisors to the diplomaticconferences held this year in geneva switzerland on proposed revisionsto the international treaty on industrial property rights commonly known asthe paris convention in all these forums the committee has stressedthe importance of strengthened patent protection to technological advancementand economic recoveryand perhaps as significant in this time of economic difficulties thepatent and trademark committee has fulfilled its  activities with almostno expenditures for outside assistance either technical or legal withone minor exception all written comments were prepared and advocacy activitiescarried out by committee members other designated cma member companyrepresentatives and cma staff we also do not anticipate any major outsideassistance expenses curing finally the patc believes that an important part of its role lies incommunication with all cma member companies both through the cma boardof directors and through other member company representatives on developments in the industrial property rights area we therefore work toincrease awareness of the importance of these issues among member companiesand in return to obtain an understanding of member company positions onthese issues armed with this information the committee is able toformulate proposed cma positions for board approval in this communicationsrole in  the patc has informed the board of a number of patent issuesincluding paris convention developments has held an open committee meetingand has communicated with member companies through such mechanisms as actionadvisories and newslettersthis executive summary has been excerpted from page two of the followingreport the section entitled patent and trademark committee activities andaccomplishments overview icmacma remarks to cma board of directorsby roy h massengillchairman patent and trademark committeejanuary  the year  has marked three major milestones in the reform andimprovement of the patent system better to meet the needs of fostering technological progress procedures are now in place to obtain a higher quality patentbefore issuance to obtain less costly determinations of patent validitywithout expensive litigation and to obtain more certain application of thepatent laws in litigation progress has been more difficult in changing thesubstantive law to restore a full patent term for products whose introductionhas been subject to regulatory delay unfavorable changes in domestic federallaw to regulate contracts with employed inventors have been averted so farattempts by developing countries to force early consulsory licensing or cancellation of patents have also been put off so far the year  will bringrenewed discussion on all three of these substantive matters patentterm restoration employed inventors contracts and compulsory licensing ofpatents in third world countries it will also bring we hope reneweddiscussion of two changes in the substantive us patent law regarding international trade and renewed discussion about interference practice inventorshipin the corporate setting and other matters your cma patent and trademarkcommittee will work to help formulate and enunciate cma policy on these issuesand to communicate with cma member companies on developments in these areasi patent reforma examination many cospanies can expect patent costs to go up nextyear because of the us patent and trademark office pto fee increaseseffective october   that represent the first fee increase in almost years in combination with new management at the us patent and trademarkoffice the hiring of more examiners better examiner training better maintenance of the search files and an overdue trial of automated searchingthese fees will we hope bring a steady improvement in the system underwhich patents are granted and trademarks are registered in the us weexpect several procedural changes to be discussed next year that will enablethe additional resources to be used to shorten the period it takes toissue a patent or register a trademark while reducing the proportion thatare issued improperly because of such curable errors as prior art referencesmissing from the patent examiners search fileb alternative to litigation the reexamination system now in place isdesigned to provide a quick and lowcost administrative procedure to have anissued patent reviewed by the pto for patentability against printed priorart raising a new question of validity while the courts seem in generalwilling to defer to the patent office on such issues the use of reexaminationhas been less than had been predicted by its proponents perhaps more time isneeded for patent owners and others to use this system more regularly as analternative to litigation in any event recent legislation has opened upissues of patent validity and infringement as proper subjects for arbitrationcma by next year we should begin to know whether or not this new alternative toexpensive patent litigation will be used widely arbitration may be thepreferred route for deciding if sensitive commercial activity invalidates apatent on either prior use or best mode grounds or avoids infringement fortechnical reasons which neither party wishes to be made public reexaminationwill remain the nonlitigation alternative for dealing with printed prior artc litigation improvement a major change in  has been the creationof the court of appeals for the federal circuit which has appellate jurisdictionover all cases arising under the patent laws as well as over appeals from thepatent and trademark office by developing a uniform body of interpretationsit is hoped that this court will eliminate forum shopping in patent litigationbecause the court was formed by the merger of  one court with experiencein appeals from the patent and trademark office and from the internationaltrade commission and  another court with experience in claims against thegovernment this new appeals court can be expected to show a high level ofunderstanding of the technical and commercial significance of patentsii legislation carried overa patent term restoration the biggest disappointment this year hasbeen the failure to enact legislation extending the term of patents whoseeffective term has been eroded by years of regulatory delay as dickwaterman reported to you last year the cma patent and trademark committee had aprincipal role in drafting this legislative proposal following the leadof the pharmaceutical manufacturers association we hope to push this billinto law during the next congress the press of other business and oppositionby key senators and congressmen prevented this bill from being enacted inspite of majority support in both housesb employed inventors agreements two attempts were made last yearto regulate by federal law the contractual relationship between employed inventors and their enployers we expect these efforts to intensify next yearparticularly in the area of defining fields in which the employees inventionsare assigned to his employer and other fields in which the employer hasno investment the topic of statutory compensation to employees when theirinventions are used commercially will also be raised these issues willbe monitored closelyand reconmiendations for cma positions will be madeif congress seems likely to act on either proposaliii international   developmentsthe major developments on the international front have been recent attemptsby developing countries to revise the paris convention the basic internationaltreaty regarding patent filing to permit a country to order cancellation orcompulsory licensing of a patent not locally worked within a few yearswhile the us government has been supportive of industry in opposing theseproposals we have had to work with our counterparts in europe to encouragetheir governments to take a similar standcma iixaa changes in the us substantive law regarding extraterritorialapplication of us patents there are two provisions of us patent lawwhich differ from the laws of most other countries in a way that places aus manufacturer at a competitive disadvantage in international trade whenhis sole patent protection relates to improved processes for making knownproducts as is often the case in the chemical industry he cannot use thecourts to challenge those practicing the process abroad and importing theproduct his remedy before the international trade commission has many otherconditions unrelated to patent issues that he would not have to meet in anormal civil action an analogous provision of us law provides no effectiveremedy for the holder of a patent on a machine having several componentsagainst another party who manufactures the consonants in the us forassembly abroad we will be reviewing proposed legislation next year toremedy both of these problemsb changes in interference practice we will also be reviewingproposals to reform the interference practice used by the us patent andtrademark office to determine priority among inventors claiming the sameinvention in order to expedite these determinations a symptom of problemsin this area is that a patent is now issuing on crystalline polypropylene thatcould be enforceable until the end of the centuryc other issues other areas that we plan to review are the treatmentof related inventions by different combinations of inventors in the orporatesetting uniform policies for ownership of patents data and softwareresulting from governmentfunded research and the possible implementationof the examination chapter of the patent cooperation treatyconclusionthe current political climate represents an unprecedented opportunityto reform the entire patent system in the us to make patents reliableassets for investors in technology the increased costs and delays associated with bringing innovative products and processes to market make theneed for enforceable patents and affordable enforcement procedures moreurgent we hope that  brings continued improvements in these areasdomestically together

committeethis morning ill be reporting to you on the work of cmas internationaltrade committee in  the second year of its formal existence itsobvious to all of us that in recent years chemical industry sales andearnings have depended upon large volumes of exports three measurementscurrently however are on an unfortunate downtrendin  the dollar value of us chemical exports was  billionin  the value slipped to billionfor two consecutive years the trade surplus in chemicals  the excessof exports over imports  has decreased the   and  dollarvalues were respectively  billion  billion and  billionover the same twoyear span the share of industry sales going to theexport trade has declined from  percent to  percentthe two sides of our current trade reality are clear chemical exportsare decreasing while at the same time imports are on the risetheres another trade reality that the us chemical industry has toreckon with as well and that is the swing toward protectionism we areseeing all around the globe  including the us this industry isconfident of its ability to compete in world trade  to the extent thatwe are not blocked from doing so by governmental barriers whether thegovernment be our own or that of a foreign country while the wordsof the international trade cosnittees charter may say it more colorfully a shorttext version of our mission is to work to remove existingbarriers and to derail attempts to create new oneswith this mission as our focus this morning ill be covering what isee as the committees major accomplishments during the year and themajor issues before us in first a word on organizationin  two task groups were refocused and a new task group created bringing our task group number to five we broadened the mission of thenorth american trade policy task croup to include all import mattersaffecting cma member companies the task groups name was changed toimport policy task croup we expanded the membership of our multinationalcorporations task group and changed its name to the intergovernmentalorganizations task group to better reflect its proper focus early incma the year we formed an investment policy task group to more adequatelycover this policy area and to provide support to dexter baker who is nowchairman of the investment policy advisory committee set up by the traderepresentatives officesince i plan to cover  accomplishments by task group area of concernthe investment group is a good place to start shortly after its formationthe group focused on the subject of bilateral investment treatiesthrough its work we were able to give the associations view on a modeltreaty to united states trade representative ustr ambassador brockinvestment treaties specific to egypt and panama were also discussedwith ustrthis group also prepared and distributed to member companies a survey onforeign investment to provide the committee with member input on specificproblem areas that should be addressed fiftythree companies respondedand the data provided is now being analyzed by the task groupiturning to the intergovernmental task group a main concern of its memberslast year was the socalled vredeling proposal in the european coonunityas leo johnstone reported to you in october the thencurrent draft ofthe proposal called for advance consultation with workers on a variety ofmanagement decisions  including investments in other parts of the worldthe association supported the joint national foreign trade couneiluscouncil position on the issue and the heavily amended version that wasapproved by the european parliament was clearly a defeat for its backersand was viewed as resulting from effective lobbying by us multinationalsa major reason behind the formation of this task group was the varietyof activities concerning international companies going on in variousagencies of the united nations during  these activities were prioritized from the us chemical industry perspective and a number of meetingswith un officials took place  including one with us ambassadorkirkpatrickwhile developing countries often seem to be the loudest voices in the unthey are also loud in their demands for special treatment by individualindustrialized countries  notably the united states and particularlywith respect to our treatment of the products they wish us to importthe general system of preferences gsp is an important us recognitionof this demand the system offers dutyfree entry of a wide variety ofcommodity and finished goods gsp became effective january   andwill expire on january   the ustr administers gsp and it and thecongress are expected to be holding hearings this year on its renewalpreparatory to our active involvement with this issue the import policytask group prepared and distributed to selected cma members a questionnairedesigned to gather data on member awareness of and concern about gspour position is now in the early development stageiicma the us tariff schedule in general is getting cma attention due to theprogram to harmonize our schedule with the customs corporation councilnomenclature which is used by most of the worlds other industrializednations late in  the international trade commission releasedchapters  and  of the new code these deal with commodity inorganicand organic chemicals respectively chapters  dealing with enduse chemical products are expected to be released in february theentire project is scheduled to be concluded by july   with implementation of the new harmonized code set for mid while unable totake positions on individual products cma recognizes its potentialimportance to members as some products will see significant tariff increasesor decreases because of this we sponsored  with socma and spi  atrade seminar on the subject that was attended by  industry representativeswe will continue to supply timely information and procedural guidance tomember companieson a matter specific to this hemisphere the import policy task groupreviewed the administrations caribbean basin initiative which was athreepronged program of trade tax incentives and supplemental aid tothe caribbean basin countries to assist their economic progress cmadid not take a position on this subject in that the bill currentlydrafted does not offer significant chemical investment potential eitheras an opportunity or threat for us producers however we continue tomonitor the bills progressanother piece of legislation on which we took no specific position wasthe export trading company act which is now law this legislation mayhowever be helpful to smaller companies and through the cma news weinformed members who might be interested in the subject about commercedepartment and us chamber seminars dealing with itduring  a host of protectionist cries were raised in washingtonmany of which prominently featured a new buzzword reciprocity ourexport policy task group was active in an industry coalition supportingsenator danforths bill s  which provides for extending section of the trade law to cover services intellectual property rights andforeign direct investment in july cma endorsement

dealing with one specific policy issue that of the export of socalled hazardous substances the rescinding ofpresident carters overly restrictive executive order was a direct resultof chemical industry efforts and a number of cma suggestions have beenincorporated in the present acceptable form of the proposed new order nowin the white house our objective all along has been to keep this as asimple notification scheme  without any form of government control andnot tied to specific shipments so far weve succeeded to put theindustry stake here in perspective the wrong outcome on this one wouldimmediately put into jeopardy some half billion dollars worth of pesticidesexportsin addition to issues worked mostly within our task groups the committeehas been active in a number of other areasa primary area of activity has centered on petrochemical discussionsbetween the us and other governments while discussions with the connonmarket were dormant during  cma provided two groups of advisors toassist the os trade representative and the department of commercerespectively in preparing for and carrying out talks with japan and mexicous efforts in the japanese talks were directed toward giving them abetter understanding of what they considered to be our unnatural advantagein natural gas pricing mexican focus while not yet clarified isexpected to be on the export of their products into the us leo johnstonehas led the cmafielded groups of industry advisors with excellent resultsto date with respect to the mexican talks the committee formulated aset of proposed us objectives and passed these to commerceone thing these discussion activities highlight is that us industrywith all its problems is far from being alone in searching for solutionslast month delegations from cma and cefic met  at the europeansrequest  to discuss common views with respect to a number of international trade mattersa familiar response to a perceived problem is to initiate a study during six separate studies regarding various aspects of petrochemicalcompetitiveness were progressed by various us agencies these includethe commerce department the international trade commission two studiesthe ustr the world bankimf and the office of technology assessmentthe committee and member companies assisted to the degree possible witheach in connection with one of the international trade commission studies on investment performance requirements  the committee prepared astatement for the record on the shortcomings of the questionnairedesigned to provide its data base the use of these various studiesbureaucratic study often is not a precursor to but more times than nota substitute for meaningful actioncma if these governmentinitiated studies were not enough last year thecommittee reported to you that we were working to develop a study of thechemical industrys international trade problems this was dropped as achemical industry project but an ad hoc group of industry members haveinterested the american enterprise institute in conducting a wider studyof us trade policy cma has reviewed and taken no exception to theinitial effort to scope the study the association will not be participatingas a financial supporterwith governmental and media interest in trade at seemingly an alltimehigh the committee felt it worthwhile to develop for its own use a setof general communication guidelines which put current and future tradepolicy matters in perspectiveon a related topic the development of positions is effective only insofaras they are communicated in addition to the specific targeting of positionpapers ive mentioned earlier late last year the committee put togethera compendium of its positions and background papers this was distributedat our october open meeting and subsequently mailed to each member companytrade contact additionally throughout the year trade contacts wereprovided with information on a wide variety of trade related topicswhats ahead for us this yearthe short answer is more of the samegovernmenttogovernment petrochemical discussions still will be with usmexico is currently anticipated to be the most important in  but japantalks could be reinstituted at any time canada also at any time couldinitiate a request for discussions while in recent months europeantalks have been dormant these too could awakenwith respect to the export of hazardous substances issue  should thepresidential executive order be as we expect acceptable to industry thissubject will still demand close cma scrutiny in its subsequent legislativeand regulatory phaseswe also will be closely monitoring developments as ostr and congressformulate their policies regarding renewal of the generalised system ofpreferenceswe can expect protectionist voices to continue calling for reciprocitylegislation with other groups cma will continue to push for s without amendments this isnt going to be easy and i cant say theoutlook is very favorablewe will continue to work closely with ustr and others as appropriate onbilateral investment treaties and other investment related issuescma the un moves slowly but given its role as a forum for developingcountries and given these countries attitudes about multinationals andtheir role in the new economic order and a host of views that boildown to an it is more blessed to receive than give posture selectivemonitoring of un activities is clearly warrantedand well no doubt have some surprises from legislators and regulators both here and abroad  as they seek to further their individual causesat chemical industry costfor its work in  the committee has the resources it needs it hasan active and knowledgeable membership its task groups have excellentparticipation and management committee and task groups benefit fromexcellent cma staff support  and from the active and effective participation of industry leaders such as leo johnstone and dexter baker whowith conmittee members and cma staff have maintained close ties with keygovernment people he have excellent rapport and high credibility in thisgeneral area of trade where industry objectives are similar to those ofthe administrationin closing i would however ask each of you to consider the activeparticipation of your trade experts in our committee task groups if youperhaps have no one in your organization who you would judge to be suchan expert i submit that you seriously consider developing that expertisei further submit that membership on one of our task groups is a costeffective way to obtain it i firmly believe you need this expertisein past years trade as such may not have been all that glamorous asubject but if one measures glamor by the amount of news media attentiona subject gets that past truth is truth no longer glamor aside imhopeful that my presentation this morning has helped underscore thesubjects importance to this industry today  and more importanttomorrowcmaexecutive summaryin  the major tax problems faced by the chemical industry werepresented in the context of legislation to reduce growing federal budgetdeficits in significant part by increasing taxes on business tax measureswhich are considered in this political context are judged primarily ontheir ability to raise federal revenues rather than on merit or reasonduring this past year cma and its member companies were successfullargely by limiting legislativetax losses rather than by obtaining newtax benefits although these achievements were made in the context oflegislation which substantially reduced the income tax benefits of investingin chemical plant and equipment they were nonetheless important theseachievements includeoooorejection of proposed alternative minimum taxmaintenance of foreign tax credit and deferral of taxon current foreign income of foreign subsidiariesmaintenance of domestic international sales corporationsdisc provisions with current benefits reduced by  percentmaintenance of accelerated cost recovery system acrs withreduction of  percent of acrs benefits when full  percentinvestment tax credit is taken on acrs propertywith federal budget deficits for fiscal  and fiscal  now projectedto exceed  and  billion respectively we anticipate that the administration and the congress will again seek in the th congress to reduce th sdeficits through tax increase legislation the problems encountered in by cma and the chemical industry are likely to be repeated in in this environment the tax policy contittee will direct its efforts in to the following major tax goals and objectivesooooooooomonitor tax and funding aspects of public compensationlegislation and consult with other cma committees onappropriate actionmaintain tax incentives for us exports which are at

good year for the chemical industry in terms of us taxpolicy changes in us tax law adopted as the tax equity and fiscalresponsibility act of  tefra now place the chemical industry in aposition worse than when this administration took office it is importantto note that the tefra changes were not as adverse proportionately forother industries such as basic metal production or oil refininghow bad were the  changes in  the superfund legislation wasadopted many observers in the chemical industry viewed that event asone of the worst that has ever befallen this industry superfund callsfor the collection of about  billion over a year period this isan aftertax amount of about  million per year of which the chemicalindustry is paying  percent or  million per yearin fact actualcollections are somewhat less because of low industry operating levelsthe  percent reduction in investment tax credit costs the chemical industryover  million annually more than twice as much as superfund rememberthe reduction in investment tax credit was only one part of the adversechanges in tefraironically much of the adverse impact from tefra may not be felt by theindustry in  because of the poor overall condition of the us economyon the positive side several adverse proposals did not become law theproposed alternative minimum tax was not adopted there was no legislationmaking significant adverse changes in the us taxation of foreign sourceincome the acceleration of depreciation from  to  years that hadbecome law in  was preserved although the future improvement in therate of depreciation that was to have become effective in  and  waslost with an impact in those years of more than  billion in cash for theindustryhaving set the stage with these comments on the state of tax affairs letme assure you that the tax policy committee is alive and well and doingits best in light of the help we get from our friends in governmentthe committees membership presently stands at  committee meetings aregenerally attended by moreindividuals than that number all of the membersare active and each one brings a valuable perspective and insight to theconmittaecma we have three operating task groups capital formation foreign taxationand value added taxation we are in the process of establishing a new taskgroup in the area of state and local taxation this latter area has becomeof more concern with the concept of new federalism and the concommitantneed for more funds by the statesin the task groups we make an effort to include persons other themcommittee members this gives an opportunity for a larger group to participatein industry tax affairsit also provides the committee with an opportunityto obtain the special talents of experts and an opportunity to see prospectivefuture committee members in actionthe role of the tax policy committee is to keep you advised of all relevantdevelopments in the tax area to do this we carefully watch proposed legislation the promulgation of new regulations prospective treaties and newlitigation where any of these facets of developing tax law alert us tochanges that affect the industry we will advise you on the implications ofsuch developments where appropriate we will suggest policies the industrymay wish to followin developing new industry positions we work towards a consensus view afterall a position cannot be that of the industry unless substantially all ofthe members find it at least acceptable that means the debate is occasionally crisp nonetheless we generally can reach quick accord because werecognize the other side is the government and it wants our moneytax legislative policy probably presents a different problem than any otherissue the industry faces tax legislation is an everpresent issue that isnot resolved by a legislative enactment instead the federal tax law isunder ongoing review by the senate finance committee and house ways and meanscommittee and the various staff organizations as well as the individualmembers staffs there has been some sort of serious tax legislative thrustposed in each congressional session since  significant laws were enactedin         and  because of theongoing nature of these enactments and because of the peculiarly complicatedand highly technical nature of this legislation it is necessary to providecontinuous review and contact particularly with the staff persons in congressand treasury who are responsible for developing new legislationmember companies carry out this activity on an individual basis both throughtheir technical tax staffs and government relations offices the continuityin the tax policy connittee as presently constituted better enables us tofollow and adopt sound positions in the everchanging matrix of technicalproposalscma cmas staff representative for the tax policy committee came to us from thehouse ways and means committee and as a consequence can and does assistthe committee in being aware of what is happening in the staff arenaskneipatwtfryithe committee continues to use the law firm of miller and chevalier as outsidecounsel messers sherfy and heyde from that firm provide valuable assistancein drafting position papers for the committee after the positions are established they and other members of the firm provide valuable insights on a varietyof tax issues as new situations developduring  we foresee development of a number of serious tax issues with abudget deficit in excess of  billion it is almost certain an effort willbe made to raise taxes including the corporate income tax several areas arelikely to be affected probably there will be a second bite at the investmenttax credit apple if recapture of the whole credit is taken out of basis thecredit would be reduced to about  percent with an additional cost to thechemical industry of  million there is a sentiment to tax employeebenefits such as medical and other insurance premiums and perhaps some formsof deferred compensation not presently taxed there seems to be a renewedinterest in taxing the overseas operations of us corporationsftera new tax thrust is posed by the socalled public compensation legislationthe tax watch on this legislation is critical in my view this could be alegislative catastrophe for the industryisjdssit is likely there will be changes during  in the way us exports willbe taxed it is clear that the members of the gatt council are convinced thatthe existing domestic international sales corporation disc is in breach ofthe subsidies code our deputy trade representative has agreed the administration will prepare legislation in this area although treasury has recommended that the disc be repealed and that no tax substitute be establishedin its place there is good sentiment for a continuation of tax support forus exports the tax policy committee will press strongly for a tax systemthat provides export assistance at least equivalent to the disc  here ipause for my only coranercial we of dow hope youll support an effort torevise the system so the presently accrued disc earnings will not be taxed inthe future believe me it is more important to most of you than it is to meend of commercial we await

the communications committee appreciates this opportunityto bring you uptodate on our industrys communications programs priorities and problemsin the next few minutes iwould like to outline a new direction in the focus of ourcommunications program share with you several examples of howcma communications activities support our industrys goals andlastly touch on the future communications challenges facing ourindustrybut first a brief overview of how the public perceives thechemical industry may be of interestthe negative perceptionthat the public has of our industry has not changedthe publicbelieves that the industry is irresponsible in its management ofwastes and is unwilling to deal with critical environmentalissues unless forced by federal and state legislationthe publics perception of us as bad guys is influenced andreinforced by a news media which is steadily chipping away atthe private enterprise fabric of our societyby docudramasthat protray business and businessmen as dishonest and motivatedby money aloneby the outcries of environmentalists and selfstyled protectors of the public interestits no wonder is it that opinion survey after opinionsurvey shows such a negative public attitude toward our industrywith the hazardous waste issue the foremost issue preoccupyingthe publics perceptionand like it or not perception equalsreality in the publics mindour cause is not aided either by the fact that the administration because of economic and other political considerationshas not been able to provide the leadership necessary to influencelegislative activities to deal with the problems of our industrywithin the past six months cmas communications program hasundergone a significant change in directionthree factors areprimarily responsible for bringing about this changeone willcertainly come as no surprise to anyone in this room  theeconomy has not been kind to our industryin this adverseeconomic climate the communications committee recognized theneed to reduce communications expenditure a decision consistentwith actions taken by many member companiesas you know asubstantial reduction in cma communications expenditures occurredin the print advertising areaas a result of eliminating thenational print advertising program the  chemcap assessmenthas been reduced from  percent to  percentthe second factor contributing to a change in the directionof our communications program is a closer liaison with cmasgovernment r lations committeecma a strong relationship between government relations andcommunications is essential when you consider the necessityfor our industrys communications to be focused around andin support of the legislative issues facing our industryastronger bridge has been built between the communications andgovernment relations committees for crossfertilization of ideasand planning communications strategies and building constituenciesthis is a relatively recent marriageat this point both partnersare enthusiastic about the opportunities for coordinating cmacommunications more closely with government relations objectiveswe look forward to the day when this approach bears fruitthe third element of the new direction in our industryscommunications activities is a desire to try new and differentapproaches in our ongoing commitment to reshape the publicsnegative perception of our industrywe recognize that we arelocked into a constant and shifting battle for the publics understanding and supportresults are difficult to come byvictoriesare fewbut we must vote present on the issues and use everymeans at our disposal to communicate the industrys accomplishmentsand commitment on industry issueswe have initiated two activitieswhich illustrate the use of innovative communications approachesto accomplish these objectivesone involves a pilot regionalcommunications program in cooperation with the louisiana chemicalassociationthis program will be tailored to that states communicationspriorities and the leadership is being provided by louisianachemical association and its member companiesfunds are being madtiavailable from our communications budget for one yearthe louisiana experiment begins this monthwe hope that the experiencegained will be useful in developing model communications programsfor use in other states to develop public policy support at thegrass roots levelanother innovative approach involves a grass roots communications program in support of clean waterthis is the first timethat we have targeted a single message within key congressionaldistricts to build a coalition of supporters and activate a publicrelations campaign at the grass roots levelhere again this isa learning experience and we are hopeful that it will produceresults which can be applied elsewherepersonally speakingi am excited about these new approachesand the new direction that our communications program is takingi know that our communications committee shares this feelingthe members of our committee  your employees  have contributedgreatly to shape and guide these new communications activitiesnow i would like to touch on the other communications activities which continue to play an important role in cmas overallcommunications programcma i am referring to such activities ascmas media tours which are planned around a specificissue and targeted for maximum impact in geographical areas andcongressional districtsmedia tours consistently deliveredresults and we are increasing the tours in broadcast communications is another resultsorientedcommunications activitycma now broadcasts a regular seriesof threeminute radio features dedicated to major issues of theassociation and distributed biweekly to  stationsethe balanced television newsfeed continues to be a keyingredient in our news activitiesfor example we fed a recentfeature on superfund via satellite to more than  stationseconsumer information programming  this activity continues to generate results and good will for our industry andmaintains mutually beneficial relations between cma and consum rpublic interest educational and other influential groupsthobjective here is also to advocate our position on major issuesas well as provide a forum for member companies to talk about theirindividual product benefitsat conventions like the american women in radio and television industry experts are interviewed on a variety of subjectsin the aftermath of the train derailment at livingston louisianacmas chemtrec staff and news service department turned someadverse circumstances into a positive media experiencein the time remaining i would like to take a prospective lookat the major issues confronting our industry and suggest some waysthat our communications committee is considering addressing theissues in support of our industrys positionthe biggest single issue which adversely affects the publicsperceptionof our industry is hazardous waste disposalnotwithstanding efforts by our member companies and an ongoing programby cma itself the public perceives that they are at great riskfrom chemical wastesthe hazardous waste issue has such a gripon the national consciousness that this single issue affects thepublics perception on other industry issues such as clean air andclean waterlater on today i will have the opportunity to address the public perception of hazardous waste issues as part ofa waste management plan presentation to be considered by theexecutive committeein closing i would like to acknowledge the contribution ofindividuals on our committee and thank you for contributing theiradvice and counsel on the tough communications problems ourincustry is facingtheir efforts continue to make a real contribution to

with the international consequences of efforts bynational governments groups of governments andor international organizations to manage the identification and control of chemical risks tohuman health and the environmentthe us chemical industry trade associations and their member companieshave actively supported a constructive domestic policy on the identification and control of chemical risks to health and the environment suchmatters may cross national borders as does the flow of chemicalsubstances and chemical industry investment there is growing international initiative in the health safety and environmental arena thusit is necessary that the us chemical industry via iag develop andsupport a constructive international policy to meet the need forincreased international understanding of and commitment to theseobjectivesduring the past three years iag has held numerous meetings with theeuropean council of chemical manufacturers federations cefic comprises many national chemical industry trade associations includingthose for countries within the european community this past yearmembers of iag traveled to japan to conduct discussions on matters oftesting and control of chemical substances with the japanese chemicalindustry association jcia and through jcia the ministries ofinternational trade and industry miti and health and welfare andlaborin addition to the multiplicity of laws affecting the trade of chemicalsbetween various nations is the everincreasing activity of supranationalbodies these include the european economic community eec theorganization of economic cooperation and development oecd chemicalsprogramme the united nations environmental program unep and a hostof technical and scientific programs that fall under various unitednations and other global governmental programscma possibly the most important evidence of iags activity is in the oecdarena at the recent high level meeting ii the united states succeededin its two year attempt to avoid imposition of testing requirements fornew chemicals in the form of oecds minimum premarketing data setmpd these requirements would have been placed on new chemicals priorto manufacture in the us for domestic useunder an agreement worked out november  spearheaded by epaadministrator anne gorsuch oecd delegations endorsed a us proposalthat would allow individual oecd nations to select their own approachesfor reviewing new chemicals this success is due to a large part toiags activities working closely with those of oecds business andindustry advisory committee biac while in fact providing much of themuscle and advocacy behind bxacs positions to ensure that usindustries were not shorted in the international arena in effect oursuccess at these recent oecd meetings means that the us industrysrequirements for premanufacture notifications on new chemical substances will remain unchanged for the present tsca will not have to beamendedin this respect because of international pressures andcommitments other agreements which the us delegation obtained weregood laboratory practices to provide a reliable basis formutual acceptance of testing dataprotection for confidential

it is or will be implemented in other oecdcountries such as australia and possibly canadai ag will have a major role in participating in this comparativeexperience in the interest of international trade and against theincreasing demands for protectionism if any changes in tsca section are seen to have merit on review of the next  years globalexperience with new chemicals iag should have a critical role in thatevaluationsimilarly assessing the risk of existing chemicals will requiremonitoring of the various national programs to minimize duplication toassurethat trade disincentives are not createdand to speedunderstanding of new information testing procedures etc how much ofthis iag should or can do remains to be determinedcma international compliance programs where iag can provide guidanceare those of labeling waste disposal occupational health and possiblytransportation again the extent and depth of lags involvement inthese activities in terms of participation with other domestic andinternational chemical industry groups needs to be determinedotherlags activity in the confidentiality of identity issue in theeuropean inventory of existing commercial chemicals einecs taught usthe importance of increasing direct contacts as early as possible withthe individual national chemical industry trade associations while atthe same time coordinating with the regional groups especially ceficthis lesson can be used in the continuing aspects of this issue nowdirected at the pmn systems and probably also in the several differentlabeling systems which need to be made compatible and ultimatelyharmonized these conflicting systems are now developing in differentcountries differences are evident in the methods by which chemicals areclassified by their delayed effect hazards such as cancer the same istrue for the language used on labels to warn about these hazards forexample there is the potential of warning about a cancer hazard ineurope but not in the united states the implications of thisdifference for product liability are substantive iag has formed a workgroup to develop a route to an international consensus on this questionthis group will coordinate with the aihc and cmas osh committee aswell as counterpart organizations in the industryduring the coming months and years iag must continue to formulate andimplement programs to deal with international chemical controls we willneed to identify and analyze national and international health andenvironmental issues of concern to the us chemical industry as risingexpectations and concerns develop worldwide on chemical contaminationsw will need to develop positions responsive to these concerns developstrategy and action plans and use and coordinate appropriate industryresourcesin managing these issues we must do more to establish and maintainnational and international relations necessary for effective dissemination and exchange of information to do so means working with othertrade associations in the us and in foreign lands working with theappropriate agencies and representatives of the us and foreigngovernments wherever appropriate and with international organizationssuch as unep oecd etcin our activities we continue to examine new channels for the flow ofinformation in order to identify issues and to develop positions onthese issues as in the past we will develop numerous position paperswhere needed reports and documents and bring them to the attention offoreign chemical industry trade associations and where necessary tocontinue our direct trade

collection is already mandated by existing statuteuntil the nature and scope of this issue is better understood itwould be unwise to create a broad new public health compensationsystemin the meantime

amendmentsthat they had proposed as a result the agency advanced a set of scaleddown amendments in the hope of making some changes now however theannouncement of the special postelection session roused some hopes thattime might be available for consideration of a more comprehensive packageepas sudden switch in tactics created confusion over what they want in theway of amendmentstiiunder the

of prime importance to the chemical industry the study provision is arecognition that the bat issue is important but the chemical industry feelsthat a modification scheme should be legislated nowthe senate environment and public works committee chaired by senatorrobert stafford rvt held a general business meeting on december  and didnot consider or report on any of the comprehensive clean water

chafee rri chairman of the environmental pollution subcommittee to hold a hearing on december  focusing onthe future of the clean water act and public opinion polls senator chafeehas indicated that clean water amendments will be his number one priority in and he will try to report amendments from his subcommittee by march the government relations committees clean water act task group will

committeesmiicma in the event that a maritime reform bill is not adopted during the postelection session there is little likelihood of a bill going forwardimmediately in the next congress consensus among coalition members isdoubtful and the arduous drafting process to date has left in question many ofthe basic principles involved there is no doubt however that shippers haveaverted what was

bilateral trade agreement the intent of the agreement was to reduce mexican subsidization of industrial goods in return forapplication of the injury test in us countervailing duty actions againstmexican imports this injury test is not now applied to such imports becausemexico does not belong to the gatt and therefore cannot sign the gatt subsidies code on learning of the trade

of cma before the senatecommittee on environment and public works on superfund reauthorizationin that testimony mr holmer presented a proposed funding mechanism tomatch annual epa spending needs of approximately  million thatproposal includes the components discussed above and would raise million in addition he noted that  million would be provided fromcost recoveries and interest for total superfund revenues of  millionin response to the directive of the executive committee the task groupmet on may   to determine what is the preferred mechanism to fundor to finance an additional  million per annum the executive committeespecifically requested that the task group present a recommendation onwhether cma should adopt the arco proposal to impose a tax on corporategross receipts or if not what alternative financing mechanisms should beadopted to raise this additional revenueafter extended discussion a majority of the task group declined to recommenda tax on corporate gross receipts as an appropriate means to raise million it should be noted that the task group was closely divided on thisissue and that the minority strongly supported the gross receipts proposalin this respect congress may consider the gross receipts tax the valueadded tax and other general tax increase proposals in  to reduce thefederal budget deficitcma the task group agreed that the preferred mechanism to finance the next million increment for the superfund program would be to provide epa withsafety valve borrowing authority in that amount the task group modifiedits previous proposal on this subjectthe basic elements of the new proposal includeexpanded borrowing authority should be considered a safetyvalve that is the authority to borrow would be available onlyto finance actual superfund site cleanup expenses after therevenues in the trust fund have been expendedexpanded borrowing authority would be limited in any given yearto  millionrepayment of amounts borrowed should be amortized over a yearperiod installments of principal and interest should be paidfirst from cost recoveries and then to the extent needed fromtrust fund revenuesthe new borrowing authority would be repaid from cost recoveries andthrough trust fund revenues from contributors to the fund thus thisnew authority would leverage tax payments to meet current epa spendingneeds with the implied commitment of fund contributors to repay theseamounts over timethe second preferred option would be to appropriate from general governmentrevenues an additional  million per year the task group views theadded contribution from general revenues like the tax on corporate grossreceipts as a means to expand contributions to the fund from industryand the public at largethe third preferred option but which is not endorsed by the task groupwould be to modify or to expand the present cercla taxes possible modificationcould includeotaxing benzene toluene and xylene used in gasoline

tominimize surprise the task force has postulated four scenarios anddiscussed cmas possible actions in response to each the scenarios areas followsoscenario i a major national public health problem exists as aresult of exposure to hazardous waste sites a substantialpopulation is at riska substantial number of exposedpersons have manifested chronic disease of a type reasonablyrelated to the exposure a substantial number of persons havebeen exposed and have not as yet manifested a chronic diseaseor its symptoms latency group but realistically fear theonset of chronic diseaseoscenario ii a

to the exposure a smallnumber of persons have been exposed and have not as yetmanifested chronic disease or its symptoms latency group butrealistically fear the onset of chronic diseaseoscenario iii the data generated by the study is incompleteequivocal or unverlflable so that no inferences may be drawnconcerning human health effects resulting from exposure tohazardous waste sitesoscenario iv no public health problem exists as a result ofexposure to hazardous waste sites in any population nor willany population in the future suffer adverse health consequences as a result of exposure to hazardous waste siteswhile cka has no information from uapep on the studys conclusionsthe task group believes scenarios i and iv are unlikely and thatscenarios ii and iii are most probable nevertheless scenarios i andiv were considered in order to be complete in preparing for the studysreleasesthe chart below summarizes how the various advocacy options thatthe task group has considered

insurancexadministrativefundxfederal causeof actionxxxxxopublic health surveillance at waste sites most of theproposals related to victims compensation have attempted to deal withthe issue in one of two ways  establish a nofault federal administrative fund to reimburse alleged victims and  change existing tortlaw to shift the burden of proof to a defendant and force him to prove anegative the task croup recognized that both of these changes wereattempts to deal with the problem of causation or the relationshipbetween exposure to a hazardous substance and a disease causation hasbeen the central issue of debate on victims compensationcma after two yeers of struggle with the causation issue the taskgroup has been unable to develop any system that would change currentstandards of scientific and legal proof yet still be intellectuallyacceptable past experience with federal administrative funds clearlyillustrated the dangers of gradually increasing coverage along with analmost geometric growth in fund size changes in burden of proof doesviolence to scientific notions of cause and effect there is moreovera real danger that such a change in the tort law will be carried over toworkers compensation and product liabilitythe task group agreed that a middle ground was needed our goalwas to develop a positive program chat would deal with publicperceptions of the hazardous waste exposure problemwe recommend that cma support a revision of section  ands of cercla to provide for more site specific health studies andmedical monitoring at old hazardous waste sices our proposed changesto the statute would give the centers for disease control cdc newauthority to investigate health concerns around waste sites insituations chat posed less than a public health emergency only publicemergencies can now be investigated cdc would be able to conducthealth status surveys and screening programs of people exposed tohazardous substancesour approach treats the public perception that old waste sices arecausing disease and illness as a public health problem rather than aproblem of how to deliver compensation under the current or anyproposed legal systemthe objectives of our proposed changes to section  are providegreater flexibility than now exists to utilize that section for medicalsurveillance limit the surveillance to individuals demonstrating actualexposure from hazardous substances as defined in cercla and restricting application of tha section to site specific exposures from old sites rather chan ambient exposures the proposed statutory changeallows the administrator hew discretion in developing the protocolsfor such surveillance it was the cask groups consensus that we wouldbe better advised not to put too much detail in the statute end insteadwork with the applicable agency on the proper protocol or scheme used tocarry out the statutory mandatefurther this approach allows us to build on the uaref studyunder any of the possible results of that work the approach suggestedhere could be usedoinsurance coverage for people exposed to waste site substances in the event government health officials determine that peopleadjacent to waste sites have been significantly exposed to hazardoussubstances the longterm health status of the exposed population wouldbe uncertain to those who were exposed the uncertainty of contractinga chronic disease will likely persist in the form of fear and anxietycma the task croup is recommending adoption of private party insurancepolicies for people exposed to hazardous waste substances these wouldbe similar to the structured settlements of cort suits that somecompanies have used to resolve environmental litigation cases the taskgroup is not recommending legislative changes at this time but isstudying further whether federal government involvement in this matterwould be appropriatethe insurance policy would apply to people exposed to waste sitesubstances but who have not manifested disease at the election ofresponsible parties who are identified and connected with a wastesitethe exposed population would be offered a fullypaid insurancepolicy this policy would cover periodic medical testing andexamination for evidence of a designated chronic disease or diseaseslikely to be caused by the exposure these examinations would continuefor the life of the individual if the disease develops the policywould pay all medical expenses lost wages or earnings burial expensesand a lump sum for anxiety and psychological trauma associated with thedisease an individual accepting the insurance coverage would waivehisher tort rights against the responsible party or parties providingthe insurance coveragethe task group believes the private party insurance approachaffords companies several advantages including reducing the fear component accompanying the exposure two of these advantages areeliminating litigation costs and obtaining epidemiology data to betterunderstand cause and effect relationships between exposure to waste sicesubstances and chronic disease it offers the exposed population theobvious benefits of medical examinations and if the designated diseaseensues health care and moneythe utility of this option will depend on the extent to whichpeople have been exposed to waste site substances and therefore thenumber of people who potentially would qualify for this insurance planthe task group plans to work with insurance representatives to determinethe costs of this optionoadministrative fund if it should become necessary toestablish a separate system to compensate people for chronic diseasecaused by waste sites the cask group recommends adoption of theconcepts and principles provided the executive committee in april cma would be prepared to argue chat the principles of eligibilitydamages causation exclusivity funding and delivery mechanism chat weprepared last year should apply in any administrative fund that thegovernment tried to set up the task group has modified the originaldamages principle proposed to the executive committee in  thechange involves capping any damages award to an eligible claimant andoffsetting it with money he received from employment or ocherentitlement programs other than for damages the waste compensationprinciples proposed a year ago for an administrative fund remain intactcma members of the task group believe an administrative fund forhazardous waste compensation would be appropriate only under uarepscenario i where the study shoved a major national health problemexists past experience with other government programs involvingindustry  financed funds eg the black lung program warrantsproceeding with an administrative fund only where other legal remediesprove inadequate such a situation might exist where large numbers ofclaimants injured by waste site substances would swamp the tort systemand other compensation alternatives until this occurred though thetask group believes a federal administrative fund should be avoidedofederal cause of action in its simplest form a federal causeof action would give plaintiffs a right of access to federal courts topursue their tort claims for injuries received from exposure to wastesite substances such a right exists today under federal statute formany claimants in modified form a federal cause of action might beaccompanied by other elements affecting liability such as causationpresumptions shifting burdens of proof and strict standards ofliability once a federal cause of action became law courtinterpretation and congressional tinkering could easily modify thefederal right as originally conceived by congress and adversely affectcompanies liabilityfor these reasons the task group believes there are significantrisks in endorsing a federal cause of action provision in anylegislation on the other hand if our companies were forced to chooseamong options such as a federal administrative fund changes in burdensof proof or causation presumptions the task group would prefer aclean federal cause of actiontljiiiijjiia federal cause of action might be appropriate under any of thefour uarep scenarios

benefits at a lowtransaction cost benefit funding mechanisms in use by selfinsuredemployers and insurance carriers are reliable and reasonably efficientno state program has yet experienced unmanageable numbers ofoccupational disease claimswhile the existing workplace benefit systems are sound there hasbeen a growing perception that workplace disease victims are not treatedfairly under workers compensation laws although state laws varyconsiderably criticisms of the existing system suggest  that benefitamounts paid are coo low  that arbitrary notice and filinglimitations operate to bar many otherwise valid claims and  chatproof of occupational causation is too difficult or costly to obtainsome or all of these views are shared by organized labor some otheremployee groups some employers some legislators and some prominentacademiciansfrom an employers or manufacturers perspective it is clear thatworkplace disease claims are with increasing frequency finding theirway into the tort system in the case of a workplace exposure to aknown or suspected toxic substance a tort theory of recovery may besustained against a manufacturer of the substance or in some instancesagainst the

by the    energycommitteecma report of the engineering advisory committeeto the cma board of directorsseptember to good morning im delighted to have this opportunity to talk alittle bit about the engineering advisory committee your program bookcontains our formal report and i dont intend to go over that in detaili will use one or two specific examples from that report to illustratesome points i would like to make and of course will do my best toanswer anyquestions it engenders  or questions arising from anythingelse for that matter but i would like to editorialize a bit upon thebare listing of specific activities to leave with you the following ideasfirst eacs major role namely that of dealing with codes andstandards is an advocacy activity although it is not the type of advocacy youwill read about very often on the front page of the new yorktimes andit may or may not be dealingwith a government entity it isnevertheless an advocacy not dissimilar to cmas main thruststhe second important thought is that cma is uniquely positionedto perform that advocacy in discussing this point id like to take youthrough the criteria eac uses in selecting the tasks where that advocacyis an essential element and lead you to the final thought namely thatthe eac activities have a high payout for a very modest expenditureto those who are not close to standards activities it mightseem that setting standards should be a straightforward technical job orpure science if you will about as controversial as      that theonly problem should be to arrive at the best technical solution to whichall rational experts would readily subscribe oh would that it were soit is perhaps appropriate to spend just a few minutes to refreshour memories on the general framework of the standards system in theus standards are voluntary or consensus although in many instances one or more governmental jurisdictions give them the force of lawafter they are prepared  the national electric code is a classic example as a voluntary standard it represents good engineering practicebut all or parts of it have also been enacted into law by virtually everylocal state and federal governmental body involved with the regulationof either construction or personal safetyfrom local building codes tooshathe umbrella organization for the voluntary standards system isthe american national standards institute known as ansi for short ansidoes not write any standards what it does do is oversee the consensusprocess when   deternrlnes there has been a reasonable opportunity forall interested parties to voice a contribution and that all valid objeccma tions have been either resolved or adjudicated it will adopt thedocument as an ansi standard there are perhaps  or  thousand ofsuch ansi standards of these i would guess that something in the rangeof  to  thousand are of direct or indirect interest to the chemical industryin addition there are many standards of interest that havenever gone through the ansification process just to name one thestandard of the tubular exchanger manufacturers association or temawhich forms the backbone for most of the industrys shell and tube heatexchanger purchases remains as a manufacturers agreement not ansidocumenthow then do standards get into the ansi systemthere areseveral acceptable procedures the three most comnon are  consensusconmittee  accredited organization or  canvassthe consensusconmittee approach was originally predominant in the ansi systeminusing this path an adhoc committee is convened inherently containingconsensus that is the conmittee members are carefully selected torepresent parties of interestclassically manufacturers users technical experts the public and any special interests the committees output is subjected to public comment and when all negative conments havebeen resolved the document is adopted as a standard many of our basicprocess industry engineering standards were developed in this fashionfor example b process piping bflanges  ays pumps etchowever this mode is gradually shifting over to other forms major input to the content of such standards must come primarily from participating on the working conmittee at the moment cmaeac has only fourrepresentatives to such conmittees so you can see we have been highlyselective over the years member company direct participation has beenhigh in such activities and still forms the backbone of chemical industryinputit is only where member company direct participation cannotaccomplish the goals that cma participation is undertaken most oftenthis occurs when only organizations not individuals or companies areadmitted to membership ill say more about this subject a little laterthe second procedure recognized by ansi is that of the accredited organization here ansi certifies that the procedures of thesponsoring organization provide for achieving consensusessentialelements include public access to the work and requires broad based committee participation notification requirements rights of appealrecordkeeping and mechanisms to resolve any conflict many of our mostused standards are developed this way including the asme boiler andpressure vessel code and our favorite example  the national electriccode which is under the aegis of the national fire protection associationcma in many aspects it is difficult to perceive the differencesbetween the consensus coumittee and the accredited organization work onthe nec for example is carried out by  codemaking panels each ofabout  members plus an equal number of alternates cmaeac participates on the  panels which most closely affect the chemical industry total representatives provided by member companies at member companyexpense code panel composition includes representation from equipmentmanufacturers government officials trade unions technical societiesthe building industry contractors consumer advocates metal industriesinsulation manufacturers other trade associations nema btc vendorsthe utility industry and probably others i missed as i skinmed the listthe motivations in such a diverse group obviously differ there are manyopportunities for honest differences of technical opinion based on thediverse perspectives represented  that after all is what the consensussystem is all about but it is also possible for pet ideas or evenspecial interests to be pressed beyond the point of justificationjust one example at the last revision of the nec certaininterests sought to include a requirement for a motor disconnect switchphysically at each motor  offering as justification the safety ofpersons working on the motor for most users this is a matter of indifference not so in the process industries where such a local switchwould normally have to be explosion proof it is cmas position thatcurrent tag and lockout procedures on remote disconnect devices providedemonstrably adequate protection and that the proposal creates greatersafety hazards than the one it is intended to correct if the proposalwere adopted we estimated the cost to cma member companies at  msyrbased on the then current rate of new construction although the amountof new construction varies we observe that the normal time intervalbetween adoption of astandard for safety applicable only to new construction and the first voiceof regulation suggesting retrofit isgenerally measured in milliseconds in this case no estimate of retrofit cost has been madeone feature of the ansi system intended to minimize obsolescence is that each standard must be revised or reaffirmed within a year interval the proposal on motor disconnects was turned back at theworking conmlttee level for both the  and  versions of the neccurrent activities areaimed at the  nec once again the proposalhas failed sufficient committee support for adoption tie vote however this time appeal has brought it forth for public comnent preparatory to a floor fight at the nfpa convention the immediate task at handis to encourage sufficient public conment to lay the foundation for asuccessful floor fight if it is carried that far the electrical taskgroup is currently organizing such a campaign among member companies andother sympathizers the nfpa membership assembled in convention is thecma court of ultimate appeal in so far as technical content of the nec isconcernedalthough members of the nfpa are obviously interested insafety only a small percentage will be technically versed in matterselectricali think the parallels with other forms of advocacy areobviousit is also obvious that a single decision does not make athreat go away like bad pennies these things keep coming back and backin addition to the consensus committee and accredited organization modes of adoption there is a third in frequent use  the canvassmethod here the document is prepared by nonrepresentative means thensubmitted for public comment and acceptance all negatives must be resolvedtypical organizations using this approach include the underwriters laboratories the api and our old friends the national board ofboiler and pressure vessel inspectors most of the activities from thissource with the exception of the national board are less demanding onthe committee per se but do impact on cma staff continued participation however is a necessary prerequisite to our credibility whenclaiming to represent the chemical manufacturing industry in othermatterslet me turn away from the ansi tutorial to the question of howeac selects its tasks in a very few cases only organizations such ascma representing identifiable blocks of interest will have access hereobviously if it is worth doing cma should do it the option is abstention there are only seven official cma representatives plus two alternates in such categoriesi mentioned before that the major standards effort comes fromdirect member company participation rather than cma participation eacdoes attempt to track participation in areas of significant interest andmaintain an informal liaison with member company reps this contributesto a broader coverage and less redundant effortwhere the tracking indicates a lack of coverage in an area ofinterest we try to encourage some member company to fill the gap itwas this gap identification effort that some years ago spotted the factthat there was no user industry participation on the nec panels in thiscase the task was so complex that a more formal response was judged tobe needed and a coordinated effort was mounted which has been highlyeffective the bulk of the effort is still provided directly by membercompany volunteers but without the coordination available only throughcma the total industry cost to participate would have been much higherand is unlikely to have been as effective  companies  member eachon tg  reps to nec the strength of a well thought out unifiedindustry position has been amply demonstratedcma just because  standard is used by the chemical industry doesnot make it an issue the eac does not worry about nor deal with thedimensions of bolt threads we dont care much about flanges so long asthe flange we will buy next month will mate with the one we bought lastmonthbut if there is an effort at significant change as with themetrication thrust of a few years ago even flange dimensions can becomea key issue these crises come and gothe eac relies primarily on its informal liaison with membercompany representatives as well as its own membership to surface theproblem areas which are appropriate for cma attention appropriatenessis measured by potential impact on the industry and whether cma is neededas opposed to member company rep handling the matter with somesupport the net result is the very selective direct involvement by theeac mentioned before but a much wider behindthescenes impact with bothindirect and direct savings out of proportion to the modest budgeti dont want to leave you with the impression that looking at afew standards represents the sum total of eac activities response topertinent regulation and legislation is a clear mandate for examplethis year we had expected two osha proposals on electric safety topicswe were not disappointed when they didnt issue  but they will beone of our concerns growing out of several years of armwrestling with the national board of boiler and pressure vesselinspectors and the relatively satisfactory outcome at the national levelis that the arena will shift to the state level the national board isafter all composed entirely of senior state level appointees and thestate capitals are their natural habitat the eac has been working withstate affairs  vision to attempt to work out an effective early warningsystem that will be both comprehensive and cost effective a necessaryadjunct will be the necessary backup and support to the local cic if andas requiredthe eac has for a number of years sponsored a computer userforum at two year intervals these educational sessions in a rapidlymoving technology have been extremely well received and are generallyselfsupportingthis year in partial response to the bhopal incident the eacundertook to conduct a similar forum on inspection and maintenance andinstructed a newly formed task group to focus on safety through inspection and maintenance procedures and techniquesthis group will beholding its third meeting next week and seems well on the way tocreating an informative and constructive sessioncma for the coining year we planto continue the programs already in place especially thoserelated to the nec and the two forums plannedwe need to continue to strive for a comprehensive and costeffective mechanism for dealing with state level regulationof pressure equipmentin preparation for the storm of regulatory legislation thatin the wake of bhopal and later incidents now seems inevitable we need to position the eac to support theassociation most effectively some parts of this can andwill be undertaken at eac initiativefor example an increased interaction with and support to the safety and healthcommittee seems appropriate but the eac by the nature ofthe subjects it deals with and the normal working assignmentsof its members is essentially a reactive not a proactivegroup therefore the majority of issues needing attentionwill necessarily flow from the association to the eac forsupporting contribution andor prime responsibilitythank you for your time and attentionin this expurgatedversion of eac activities i hope ive left you with some key thoughts ethe whole participation in standards activities is closelyakin to more obvious advocacy initiativeseby careful selection of topics and leveragingreturns a hefty payout on funds

a good one sofarthe stakes have been high at the state levelcongress passes major environmental legislation  the cleanwater act clean air act resource conservation and recovery act safedrinking water act and superfund but all of these are minimumrequirements and the states are permitted  and even encouraged to go fartherdaniel bean writing for the policy studies journalunderscored the rising importance of state governments he saidthey are no longer regarded as horse and buggy governments as theywere in the s and are coming once again to be viewed aslaboratories of innovation and democracythe conservation foundation has pointed out thatenvironmentalists of a decade ago generally sought federal solutionsto pollution problems they now look frequently to the statesrecognizing that washington has no monopoly on environmental virtueexamples are numerous california regulations on hazardouswastes were copied in last years rcra reauthorization californialaws passed by sher and katz in  and  were models for thepresent federal regulations of pits ponds and lagoons veryrecently the league of women voters initiated a program on householdhazardous wastes focused at the local level the effort quicklyspawned twenty bills this year at the state level and promises toattract the attention of us epa if not congress even today newjersey state legislators are directly affecting the congressionaldebate on community righttoknow and catastrophe preventioncma four years ago as cma responded to the increasing importance ofstate issues they recognized the challenges the political playing field is geographically spread over states there are thousands of key players  seventyfive hundredlegislators alone with staffers and executive agency personnelnumbering thousands more there are  bills introduced each year which could affectour business timing for political action at the state level is measured indays not months or years as is frequently the case incongressto meet these challenges cma developed a unique program that isbuilt on sound managerial and political principlesset priorities on issues to make the most of limitedresourcesget involved as early as possible in the political process tomaximize effectivenessdevelop position statements and supporting arguments beforethe issue surfaces to keep up with the fast track politicalemphasize local involvement for early alert and politicaleffectiveness those on the scene have the best chance ofknowing whats developing and politicians listen best tothose who elect themto implement this program a network of state chemical industrycouncils and trade associations was chosen to be the cornerstone ofcmas field marketing force to sell our positions on priority issuesbut it was clear that the network needed lots of support anddirectionas jim murray reported last year activities were planned tocultivate that network by making cma a focal point of informationmcma gathered from the collective national resources of our industry manyf these activities are well underway and have truly turned cmainto a center of excellence for state issues member companypersonnel and state trade associations are routinely turning to cmafor advice and guidance other industry trade associations likeamerican petroleum institute and the national agricultural chemicalassociation are contacting cma on mutually important state issuesassociations of elected officials like national governorsassociation national conference of state legislators council ofstate governments and even the national association of towns andtownships are turning to cma for input on policy positions agendaideas and speakers these indications of success are gratifying butmost importantly the cma approach has clearly helped producebottom line results for member companiesour system was severely tested this year and it workedlock at some specific resultsletsby june of last year community righttoknow was targeted forpriority coverage for the then upcoming  legislative sessiondrawing on two years of experience with this issue at both the stateand federal levels cma staff efficiently pulled together a wealth ofinformation position papers with backup arguments copies of allprevious state laws and regulations and copies of testimony that hadbeen given before congress and at the state level in addition cmastate affairs group held regional information seminars on the subjectto educate members of the cics networkwhen bhopal hit in december the cma state affairs organizationas a whole was well prepared for the unprecedented flood of statehills that were promptly dumped into the legislative hopper when thedust settled this year over  bills on this subject had beenintroduced in  states and over  states passed some righttoknowprovisions state legislators had developed new proposals to forcegovernmental control on our plants and tried to move the issue farbeyond the cma positionalthough battles are still being fought in california new jerseyand michigan to date all the laws passed this year are generallyconsistent with cma policy we have retained our trade secretprotection rights and successfully avoided costly requirements forunique labeling environmental emission monitoring and independentrisk management auditpublic compensation was another priority issue where the resultswere good it was an active issue in five states  californiamassachusetts new jersey minnesota and rhode island cmas positionwas that no administrative public compensation program was needed andcma tort law should not be changed the cma policy committees marchingorders to the state troops in the field were clear  hold pork chopcma staff and member company representatives helped guide thestrategy in these states the uarep study results were effectivelyused in conjunction with expert testimony provided by personnel fromcenters for disease control academia the insurance industry thelegal profession and our own companies we were successful in fourof the five states and marginally successful in the fifthonly minnesota passed a public compensation bill whichestablished an administrative fund  and it was very limited inscope the situation there was unique in that local industrysupported the legislation because it solved some severe insurabilityproblems created by an earlier  minnesota superfund lawthe results on another priority issue  state superfund laws also were good we successfully prevented both the adoption ofunacceptable liability language and the inclusion of provisions forpersonal injury compensation state superfund fees were held withinreasonable limits although some increased significantlycma also played a role in preventing further proliferation ofunique state regulations of toxic

this media attention and despite the negative news itemsof  a professional view is that our treatment by the mediacould have been a lot worsewhile each member of thecommunications committee can recall a few horror stories from we agree that on balance the industry received fairtreatmentthis occurred as a natural result of increasedpersonal contact between the media and the members of ourindustryin

industryso to answer the question are things getting better with themedia i would have to answer a qualified yesestablished contacts and credibilitytfe haveopportunities exist forsubstantially improved media coverage of our industry in thefuturelooking to that future the communications committee is convincedthat cmas communications objectives will be best achieved byconcentrating on solving

prepared and areready to take to the publicour october open meeting was a caer communications seminar that was very well attendedwe willcontinue to recruit individual companies to actively support

perceptionworking with bob roland we recently held acma risk perception seminar for senior communications executives of adozen major chemical companiesthe result was an interestingexchange of views that should encourage a more informed publicdiscussion of this important subjectbefore closing id like to make two recommendations to you assenior executives of your individual companiesthe first recommendation relates to the communications revolutionwere seeing in our industry  the people doing much of thecommunicating are not experienced professional communicatorsthe middle ranks in our companies are being subjected to mediaattention as never before particularly your plant managersas a result we must indemnify plant managers against the risk ofworking with the media at the local plant level especially asthe caer program is implemented in each communityof all theactivities associated with the caer program the most difficultfor your plant managers is talking to the presstheir fear ithink is that a slip of the tongue or a misquote will havenegative repercussions at the home officeif were seriousabout caer and local communications we must create a climatewhere plant managers can be confident of management support whenthey speak outi realize that different companies have different policies inthis areaand therare some risks involvedbut we feel thatcma   the risks are greater if plant managers do not work with theirlocal media especially where the cash program is involveda corollary to this recommendation is that the industrysconaunicatlons people have to ensure that our plant people havethe training and support to handle this eore activecommunications roleas an example the comaunlcatlons portionof the caer handbook was a joint effort of the conaunicatlonsconaittee and cma staffour second reconaendation is based on the fact that the publicand soae of the media nake little distinction between onecheaical company and anotherto the public we are all part ofthe saae industry for better or worsethe entire industrysuffers when one of us bakes page one with an eaergency of soaesortwith this in bind each cheaical company nust ensure that itseaergency conaunicatlons procedures are asuptodate as itseaergency operating procedureswe should reneaber that there is no such thing as a nationalcheaical eaergency only a local incident that develops into anational storyif our local conaunicatlons are clear conciseand proper when an incident starts there is a far better chancethat the resulting national news stories will reflect better onthe industryand theres always a chance that if we do ourcma communications job right at the local level that the story willnot escalate to the state or national levelin conclusion its clear that we have a lot of work to do andthat were going to need all the patience we can oustera lotof positive activity is underway by cma and the neaber companiesif we just give it time to succeedgiven our continued coaaitaent to the operating andcoaaunications programs that the industry is involved with thecommunications committee is optimistic that over time we willachieve our goal of regaining the

instituted aninvestigation under section  of the  trade actagainst south korea the government is looking into theadequacy of the laws of south korea governing the protectionof industrial property rights and the effect of such laws onus trade in that country through this action andvarious other recent actions in the international tradearea the government is demonstrating its concern withunfair

extending the term of drugpatents whose effective term has been eroded by premarketingregulatory testing and review agricultural and toscachemicals were deleted from that legislation bills haveb en introduced into the current congress and hearings havebeen held on similar patent term extensions for tosca andagricultural chemicals the cma committee had a principalrole in initially drafting this legislation when it wasintroduced several years ago the committee continues toyilov and supporc this legislation albeit today in aacondary coordinating role to naca because of the moremediate concern of this bill to agricultural chemicalmanufacturersthe committee is supporting the pending process patentlegislation this is of particular significance to theunited states chemical industry although not limited toche chemical industry the chemical industry would be adirect beneficiaryit would give chemical producersadditional protection against foreign competitors who use aprocess abroad that is patented in the us and who thenimport into the us products made by that process thefailure of current us law to have such protection isconsidered inequitable because most other developedcountries have such a provision and us producers are thusplaced in an unfair competitive position in internationaltrade although some relief is now available againstimportation of such products through the international tradecommission that remedy has problems which this patent lawchange would obviateindustrial property rights are fast becoming a key issuein the international trade area the government hasrecognized that american companies have a vital interest inprotecting their proprietary positions abroad and that thegovernment should pay more attention to this element of theamerican economy in foreign trade dealings the governmentis now examining the adequacy of intellectual propertyprotection in the context of the general review of the gspg neral systems of preferences program the

counterproductive ie tax policyseme bills   to be sure   are wellconceived others  unfortunately   run the gamut from political posturing   todownright foolish gunslinging we cannot assume that wisdom

recently as    we had amanufacturing trade surplus of billionnotwithstanding this national disaster   our chemical industrystill achieved a statistical trade surplus   estimated to be billion for  although we seem to be holding our own in chemicalexports   an estimated billion in    chemical importshave been increasing rapidly   by about  per year since they reached a record billion last year   and the usas shareof world trade   declined for the th straight yearin other words   our industry trade surplus has dropped byalmost billionmyron foveaux recently gave his annual public tradeprognostication for  myrons numbers are based on the forecasts  that he obtains from about  of our chemical companies heforecasts our exports will be flat in    despite the weakeningof the dollar   and that imports will be up about  percent  to about  million that will result in another  percentdecline in our trade surplus for the year   to about  billionincreasing share of our markets at home   to foreignbasedproducerslest we draw consolation from the fact that we have any tradesurplus at all   lets dissect its meaning a trade surplus  means that the sales of our exports   exceed the sales of importedchemicals sold in the us as you know   sales alone doesnt meanmuch if your pockets are empty at the end of the trading dayi believe our trade picture   is alot gloomier than ourprojected  billion surplus suggests if we had a way tocalculate a trade profitability balance   the net effect ofchemical exports versus imports   on our aggregate bottom line  would it still be a surplus i doubt itcn the export side of the ledger   i suspect a lot ofcompanies are exporting near costs   to preserve or build volumeconsider the comment by imc president george kennedy   in the newyork times

you look at these statements in your briefing books  youll see that each is an important concept   not just a piece ofblue skytrade legislation is the other key international area   withwhich we should be concerned when i talk about trade legislation  im focusing on importrelated initiatives   changing the importremedy laws   and considering the degree   torvhich naturalresources subsidies should be countervailedcma   there are   of course   many exportrelated areas of law  that affect our trade competitiveness seme such as foreign corruptpractices and antiboycott   which were major causes a few yearsbach   are still unresolvedrealistically   if we get a single omnibus trade bill   itwill be an achievement congress was in a dither in  and noclear trade legislation picture emerged because  is an electionyear   we have a pretty small window   perhaps until june forsomething to happenwhat that bill would finally look like is anybodys guess theelements of such a bill   will no doubt be drawn from severalproposals   that were introduced last session and   possibly  from the administrations own plan so far   the administrationhas kept its own suggested wording under wrapshowever   some key points to look for are  general trade competitiveness   several proposals havebeen made   to establish a committee or council   to evaluate theeffectiveness of cur trade laws ard agreements   or to establishwhat the general objective or our trade policy should be   or somecombination of the above the object would be to elevate trades  exchange rates   proposals range from mandatory actions  to achieve exchange rate parity   to congressional statements that a conference should be held   to explore options andmechanisms   to prevent exchange rate fluctuationsvariations of a statement   to authorize the administration   tonegotiate in a new mtn round some proposals go as far as to listdetailed negotiating objectives the house republicans proposal  alone   addresses uscanada free trade clause which would allow either congress   the administration  or a private entity   to request an investigation   whether anindustry is being injured due to imports unfair trade practicesneed not be proven the various proposals would require industry  to commit to an adjustment plan   in return for a favorable finding  would give the president less discretion in overriding itcfindings   and would shorten the processing time for petitionsreally an export provision it gives the president the authority to retaliate against unfair foreign trade practices or barriersvarious proposals   would   again   shorten the processing time  include targeting as an unfair practice   and would mandatespecific s retaliation measures   against unfair processes aswith section    congress wants to tighten these remedies  cma making them more usable by business   and more predictable in theiroutcome  intellectual property rights   several proposals want totighten the prosecution of violators   and ease the process ofuncovering such violations this is particularly important topharmaceuticals   and pesticide producers  export finance   house democrats   favor increasedfuture funding for direct lending house republicans   on theother hand   want treasury and exim to have authority to matchmixed creditsthe other major importreated issue   and this one may end upin the omnibus trade package   is the question of whether upstreamsubsidies   should be countervailable as first proposed byrepresentative am gibbons in    us companies would be ableto get relief   in the form for countervailing duties   whenimports benefit substantially   from the use of a natural resourcein the manufacturing country benefit would be assumed   when thenatural resource is available to the foreign manufacturers   at aprice lower than the export price   or fair market value  whichever is appropriatethis upstream subsidies issue   is a real corker for thechemical industry   we have companies who are strongly on oppositesides of the issueat cma we have a very active working group   they met quite afew times   during a relatively short period in  that groupwas split right down the middle over this provision of the gibbonsbillat nam   the same thing happened   right down the middlethe international trade pendulum   has swung totally in theopposite direction

safety committeethis committee was formed by board action in january  toprovide the association a central focus for oversight and coordinationof health and safety policy and programs with public health and safetyconcerns being the central driving force behind most recent environmental and chemical control laws and regulations the health and safetycommittee gives cma the ability to orchestrate a consistently coordinated advocacy program for public health and safety policy the committees oversight of health and safety policy facilitates the integrationof these issues into programs and policy developments of the othercommittees resulting in a closer working relationship with the environmental management communlcations engineering advisory distributionand state affairs committees and the biomedical and environmentalspecial programsthe committee replaced two standing committees  the chemicalregulations advisory committee crac and the occupational safety andhealth committee osh two executive committee task groups  the publiccompensation task group and the uarep work group and reduced the numberof task groups from  to  this consolidation was accomplishedwithout disruption of any ongoing activities or significant loss ofrelationships with outside groups this has allowed us to address thepressing issues with fever task groups and fever people reducing thenumber of member company representatives involved requiring less traveland fewer meetingsthe restructuring of the industry and of many cma member companieshas presented unique challenges in that several of the key task groupmembers and some of the committee members have had significant jobchanges resulting in some people turnover and changes in leadershipunlike the predecessor committees or task groups the current taskgroups no longer have agencyspecific responsibility but have functionalresponsibility based upon the expertise needed by the group to carry outits mission the functional units are risk analysis risk managementrisk communications compensation and external affairs and are shownschematically on page  of the reportthe committee has  major goals that were developed at a planningmeeting shortly after the committee was formed we can pick and choosecma and appropriate task force expertise and resources needed to achievesuccessful completion of each goalthis creates a true matrix organization and allows us to focusresources on an issue without redundancy and needless waste of time forcompany or staff personnelthe committee and most of its task groups have kept busy all of because of the diversity and complexity of the issues for which thecommittee is responsible the reorganization necessary to consolidatethe ongoing activities without loss of momentum and the constant demandfor action and reaction as a result of the several chemical releaseswhich have occurred at bhopal institute and elsewhere we initiatednew programs to improve the publics perception of the chemical industryas being responsible we also have had some less visible but equallynecessary programs which are more basic and behind the scenes theseactivities usually involve generally working with legislative or regulatory contacts on issues vital to the industrythe remaining time that i have today will be spent discussing someexamples of programs followed by a brief review of areas which thecommittee anticipates will require priority attention in the futurefollowing the bhopal catastrophe a special task group chaired byhamilton hurst and reporting to the executive committee developed thetwo new chemical industry programs  program and the national chemicalresponse and information center or ncricthe caer program was assigned to the health and safety committeefor implementation and followup it has been well received and continues to generate favorable reaction from the media and regulatorsindustry reception has also been good over  companies have signedup to participate in the caer program and have named an executive as thecompanys caer coordinator the caer coordinator is a critical linkbetween the companys facilities managers and the programthe caer task group has held a series of regional workshops atwhich the program has been described to more than  chemical industry managers and over  sites have been selected to begin theprocess for implementing caer in addition community coordinatinggroups which usually include emergency response officials electedofficials and representatives of industry and the public have beeninitiated caer handbooks have been distributed in the us and othercommunications materials including slidetape shows videotapes andbrochures have received wide distribution to facilities managersemergency response groups and police and fire fighters a monthly caernewsletter is prepared and distributed by the task groupcaer has created a consnunlcatlons network for cma and membercompanies to local emergency response groups and to the epa federalemergency management agency fema other federal agencies and withother trade associationscma caer has helped to prominently portray the industry as beingconcerned with public health and safety and has given us the uniqueopportunity to build public credibility we are continuing our effortsto capitalize upon this initiative although caer has been highlysuccessful in showing positive actions that industry is taking we havesome concerns of which you should be aware and that do require attention of the  companies that have signed up for the caer program have not submitted either of the  milestone reports which are now pastdue this creates concern that ve may not be able to maintain thecredibility of the program we need your help through contacts you mayhave in other companies to continue to emphasize the importance of thecaer initiative to the current and future credibility of the industryturning now to the less visible programs the committee and its taskgroups have conducted these activities are more numerous than theupfront active visible programs such as caer and have been equallyas effective in supporting cmas advocacy positionsin response to public legislative demands following bhopal theoccupational safety and health administration osha developed theirspecial emphasis program designed to target chemical plants for additional safety and health inspections irrespective of plant safetyperformance these inspections were initially designed by osha to behighly technical indepth process hazards reviews rather than routineosha inspections by working with the agency representatives of thecommittee were able to help osha recognize its lack of expertise tocarry out such a program and then assisted in redrafting the program tobe one that only serves oshas purposes but is consistent with ourcompanies process safety management reviewsalso in the occupational safety and health arena our committeebecame aware that a representative of the international textile workersunion had chaired a committee which had completely rewritten the bureauof labor statistics reporting guidelines for occupational illness andinjury bls  this document which contained very onerous provisions for all of industry some of which are detailed at the top ofpage  in your book had already been approved by the department oflabor and submitted to the office of management and budget mb forapproval to implement by contacting mb we were able to get thedocument recalled by the department of labor and then rewritten topresent more balanced guidance on reporting occupational illness andinjuries this has been followed with extensive contacts with blsincluding taking the commissioner and member of her staff to tour plantsin our industryrepresentatives of the committee have also been very active withera in the toxic substances control act tsca area and have addressedmany of the concerns that surfaced during congressional hearings regarding assessment and management of chemicalsa dialogue group under the umbrella of the conservation foundation came to agreement on mechanisms for epa management of new chemicals after premanufacturing notification pmn this issue is a tscadeficiency that was highlighted during congressional testimonycma representatives of the tsca reauthorization task group provided theleadership to bring the industry public interest representatives andstate members of the dialogue group to closure on the program theprogram now called new chemical followup has been recommended toepa for action the agency has indicated a willingness to initiaterulemaking to codify the program thus defusing this concern in futurecongressional activitiesanother concern during congressional discussions of tsca wasnegotiated testing the natural resources defense council nrdc cmaand epa worked collectively to develop a procedure for negotiating testagreements and developing test rules under section  the new procedurewas developed under the principle that test rules and negotiated testingagreements should be equivalent and consent orders under tsca section would be the primary mechanism to satisfy that principle the consentorders as the test rules would include requirements to ensure adequateand reliable data would be enforceable and would conform to other tscaregulatory requirements in addition the new procedures would includean opportunity for public participating and an expedited schedule fornegotiating and rulemaking after final agreement by the  involvedparties epa will issue the procedures as an interim final rule infebruary or march  the result of this successful effort has beento lower public pressure to amend tsca precluding what could be moreonerous testing procedures and timetables it has also improved workingrelationships among the  parties involved in the negotiationsthe committee has also through the public compensation task groupassisted government relations in recommending and supporting variousinitiatives in the superfund reauthorization process these haveincluded recommending public health surveillance as an integral component of superfund assisting in preparing lobbying packages opposingvictimsf compensation proposals as these were introduced or discussedand communicating the results of the uarep study of possible healtheffects from hazardous waste sites the superfund bills before congresshave no victims demonstration programs no federal cause of action andmuch better health studies provisions as a resultpriority issues which are anticipated to require significantattention in the future are the followingothe occupational safety and health administration osha has beenrelatively inactive in standards development for the last  yearsfew standards have been developed and those that have been developed have responded to court mandates or intense legislativepressure industry has not had to comply with the new regulationsbut we have missed opportunities to assist in the development ofstandards which address workplace needs in a costeffective wayosha will not be able to continue being unresponsive to its legislative mandate nor is it in industrys best interest to continueto miss significant opportunities to assure costeffective practical workplace standardsthrough its national emphasis program osha has served noticethat our industry irrespective of our excellent safety recordcma will be more carefully scrutinized for workplace safety and healthwe can anticipate that in addition t increased standardssettingchemical plants will be inspected more frequently by osha thehealth and safety committee is prepared to assist osha where it isneeded and appropriate including considering the development ofsome forwardlooking programs to continue to improve the industrysimageoin the toxic substances control act tsca area biotechnologyregulation is relatively quiet now but will likely become moreactive in the future although it may become a high visibilityissue we want to keep it separate from other tsca issues we willcontinue to monitor work closely with other trade associations anddevelop positions as appropriatereauthorization of tsca has been given a lower priority bycongress for the last year largely because their calendar was sofull of other healthrelated activities this will not lasthowever we will continue to address the identified concerns andstand ready to become a player in the debate as soon as it isrejoineda national research council nrc report stated that thetoxicity data that are available on chemicals in commerce are bothvery limited and inadequate many people are now using this reportto show a supposed need for mandatory testing and a minimal testset unfortunately no readily available body of data exists togive a better understanding than is given by the nrc report thecommittee will be evaluating the accuracy of the report and whatcan be done to improve the data base and refute the report thisis probably a longer term project however and not one that lendsitself to relatively early resolutionolegislative activities will continue especially in the area of thechemical industrys effect on the health of the public and our workforce occupational illness had drawn several congressional billsrecently and the proponents of such measures have not been successful yet the committee is already actively participating in thisdebate and will continue in order to prevent our industrys operations and products from being unfairly singled out for legislativetreatmentpublic compensation activities will continue especially inthe area of product liability where we are working with the cmageneral counsels office and the government relations staff toaddress senator danforths bill the superfund reauthorizationbattle will be rejoined soon and health effects from hazardouswaste sites will continue to be one of the emotional leaders inthis struggle the public compensation task group will continue toplay an important role in this areathe issue of health effects from emissions from operatingfacilities will come more to the fore the environmental management committee assisted by the health and safety committee hascma been developing a position on this congress and the regulatoryagencies vlll continue however to use public health as thedriving force for more legislation and regulation addressed at thechemical industry the health and safety committee will continueto develop health policy for the association and to assist othercommittees and departments to respond to issues in the publichealth arenathe health and safety committee has been conceived bom andnurtured during a very trying time for the chemical industry webelieve we he successfully negotiated this traumatic birthing withoutlosing any momentum with our goals constantly in front of us and oureyes on themfone of the hallmarks of the committees activities has been to tryto address issue in there entirety by going to the heart of the problemand looking at how legislators and regulators decide to take actionusing this assessment we have addressed the issues in depth and proposed longterm fixes not just treated the obvious symptoms and provided a cosmetic cure and left the roots of the issue unattended thecommittee intends to continue this approach to the health and

industryrespondingco the numerous problems raised in both tax reform and superfundreauthorization legislation the committee effectively handled a widerange of tax issues that could increase industry tax costs by morechan  billion annuallysince november  the tax policy committee has focused onche major tax revision issues that are of continuing concern to thechemical industrythese issues were first raised in the context ofche treasury departments  tax reform proposals and later in thepreparation of cmas testimony on president reagans may  taxreform program before the house committee on ways and meansin general president reagans  tax reform program wouldshift almost  billion of the federal income tax burdens now borneby individuals to the business sectorthe presidents program wouldsubstantially increase the tax burdens of businesses chat are capitalintensive and that engage in significant international tradethe specific issues raised in the presidents program are setout in detail at tab  of our committee reportfor this reason iwill not repeat that discussion except to reiterate why federal taxissues are so vitally important to the chemical industryfirst let me emphasize that for many years the chemicalindustry has enjoyed one of the most favorable tax positions amongus industrial sectorsboth reasonable capital cost recoveryperiods and the investment tax credit have been available forchemical manufacturing investments for a number of yearsto someextent the principal achievement of the accelerated cost recoverysystem acrs adopted as part of president reagans  taxprogram was to provide other industries with tax depreciationcomparable to chat which the chemical industry enjoyedbeyond its favorable depreciation position the chemicalindustry is unique among capital intensive industries in che extentto which it can utilize the investment tax credits generatedin the chemical industry invested more chan  billion in newplant and equipment almost  percent of chose expendituresqualified for che investment tax creditin current dollars theinvestment tax credit reduces the annual tax bill of the uschemical industry by over  billionmoreover the chemical industry is far more dependent oninternational trade than many other capital intensive industriesfor example in  che united states exported chemicals and alliedproducts with a value of  billion and in chat year imported billionwith a combined total of approximately  billion incma ic is clear that cma has a strong vital interest in tax reformlegislation that reflects a uniquely chemical industry concernweare organized under a comprehensive work plan to defend theindustrys interests in taxationwe are working cooperatively toimplement that plan on capitol hillwe look forward to

proposals and later inpreparation of cmas testimony before the house committee on ways andmeans in addition the committee prepared several onepage specificlegislative issue analyses which the taxation task group of thegovernment relations comittee has used extensively in our meetingswith congressional members and staffcma commissioned price waterhouse to conduct a study of effective tax rates in the chemical industry the price waterhouse study of iscompanies who are primarily engaged in chemical manufacturing showsthat these companies paid an effective tax rate of over  percent in one of the highest effective tax rates paid by any industrygroup in that year the price waterhouse study has been distributedwidely and is being used by cma in its lobbying efforts on both taxreform and superfund the response to the price waterhouse study hasbeen very favorablein addition cma provided a grant to the institute for research in theeconomics of taxation iret for a study on the impact of selected taxreform proposals on capital formation in the chemical industry theseprovisions include the repeal of the investment tax credit reductionof depreciation benefits recapture of accelerated depreciation andincreased alternative minimum tax in its brief summary the iretstudy concludes thatmajor provisions in the presidents tax reform proposalsand in the tax reform options under consideration by thecma committee on hays and means would have devastating effectson the us chemical manufacturing industry particularlydamaging would be the proposed changes in depreciation rulesalong with the proposed excess depreciation recapture andthe alternative minimum taxes despite the proposedreductions in statutory tax rates these changes would raisethe effective tax rates to which chemical manufacturingcompanies are exposed and would as a result materiallyslow the growth in the industrys production facilities andemployment cost the industrys employees billions ofdollars

with osha toimprove its records inspection program and citation policy through acollaborative cmaosha educational program on recordkeeping for cmamembers by working with the agency to identify its program needs andconcerns and advocating our members interest the couittee was able todefuse the troubling osha policy on recordkeeping finss that began withthe unprecedented  million fine at

the environment theagency also believed that the regulatory process under the toxicsubstances control act tsca was too blow and cumbersome to addressadequately the problem environmental interest groups concurred withea in evaluating this situation hsc looked at how it might resolvebasic concerns about the tsca program without unfavorable congressionalchanges to the law it concluded that participating in an informaldialogue group with all interested parties could successfully lower theconcern the approach worked resulting in consensus agreements onnegotiated testing and followup reporting for newchemicals inaddition the process of informal discussion allowed traditionalchemical industry antagonists to gain a better understanding of ourconcerns and needs it has opened

issueswe also had a year without a major chemical incident to rekindlethe fears of bhopal the closest we came was the trainderailment near mlamisburg ohio fortunately there was no lossof life or serious injury and the operating and communicationspeople involved in the incident did their jobs well as aresult the accident was portrayed in the media as being as mucha rail mishap as a chemicalrelated problemperhaps the worst reporting on the mlamisburg incident may haveoccurred on the abc network coverage of the golf tournament thatwas being played in nearby dayton at the time of the wreck ican remember cringing in front of ay tv set watching andlistening to those two noted environmental reporters  dave harrand jim mckay  discussing how to play golf in sulfur fumesdirectorcorporate media relations amoco corporationcma fwe also seemed to have escaped much residual blame for the recentrhine river spill in switzerland frankly im at a loss as towhy that incident didnt receive more critical coverage in theus but im sure not complaining about it each day without apageone incident puts bhopal one more day behind us also saw a remarkable communications effort in theindustrys support of the caer program at the local level if wehad the time i could have filled both days of this meeting withsuccess stories on the communication of the caer program in ourplant communitiesin fact  could be called the year of the chemical plant openhouse the chemical industry held more open houses than century last year and the overwhelmingly positive results reflect theconsiderable effort that went into these activities i cantrecall a single negative episode in the thousands of caerrelatedcommunications activities that took place in these local activities have further enhanced the role of thechemical plant manager as a communicator in his local communitythese individuals today are more willing and capable ofrepresenting your companies and our industry than ever beforeits also clear to the committee that many companies are nowplacing increased value on communications skills when seniormanagement selects the people to serve as your plant managerson the media relations front in  the committee felt that wegenerally received fair coverage our relationships withenvironmental reporters for many major media were furtherstrengthened during the year familiarity breeds respect in this regard and we had another year to increase our industryscredibility with these reporters in addition all of our skinsgot a little bit thicker in  as the industry learned anewthat working with the media is a tough nononsense and sometimefrustrating part of all of our jobs as a result our collectivetolerance level with the media is even higher than it was wehave learned that no one story or single episode is critical andthat its the long term results that count in working with thepressas a result of these and other efforts in  the publicsopinion of our industry improved at least if you believe thepublic opinion surveys i wont go into all the statistics buti think a few trends are worth commentaccording to one prestigious national survey the publics viewof our industry improved measurably our approval rating in thissurvey increased by about  percent during  howeverfairness requires me to point out that we started the year deadlast among  industries with a rating so low that anyimprovement would seem large by comparison this improvementthough slight moved us from th place to about th or th oncma the industry list were above the alcohol and nuclear powerindustries and very close to the electric utility industry nowour standing doesnt begin to compare with the ratings of thetoprated computer industry or the food and retailing industriesbut we moved up a notch or two and our ranking is the highestits been since  that has to qualify as good newsthis survey showed two other items of special interest firstin a special questionnaire the plastics industry received anapproval rating that would place it at about th place on theindustry list since many of the companies here today havesome interest in plastics this approval rating should beencouragingand secondly the oil industry which for years had been in thepublics doghouse improved noticeably in  the oil guyswere in last place by the fourth quarter of  oil had movedall the way up to about the middle of the  industries somajor improvement is possible if we persevereother results from other surveys show mixed results  either thepublics opinion about us stayed the same or improved onlyslightly we seem to be rebounding slowly from last yearsrockbottom ratingsyet we should not confuse these slight improvements with anylessening of the publics concern about the environment and ourindustrysurvey after survey continue to show that the american peopleplace environmental concerns very high among their prioritieseven to the point of preferring the environment over jobs orhigher prices when faced with a choice in the surveysthe public feels that the environment is improving but feelsthat the improvement has been progressing too slowly and thatnobody  business or government  is acting quickly enoughthe public continues to rank the disposal of hazardous wastes asits number one environmental concern and cites the chemicalindustry consistently as the countrys primary source of air andwater pollutionfaced with these conditions the communications committees objectives reflect our enthusiasm to support chas advocacyefforts and the opportunity to parlay these efforts wherepossible into improved communications with the public at largeheading our project list for  is the followup on our caercommunication achievements of  if there is a cma memberplant that hasnt yet conducted a caer communications activitywe want to find it and get it on track with the rest of theindustrycma caer has been the leadership effort for the chemical industryduring this decade and we must not let it wither  either in anoperating or a communications sense the committees greatestfear is that our plant people will become complacent about caernow that they have gone through all the effort of establishing itin their communities pardon the pun but caer will require alot of tender loving care in the future if it is to continue asthe industrys flagship health and safety programanother of the many values of caer is that it gives us theopportunity to deal from strength in conducting our futurecommunications activities at the plant level with this in mindthe committee and cma staff are building on caers success intackling the industrys two upcoming communications hurdles air toxics and the implementation of the title iii provisions ofsuperfundin the air toxics area a survey of the committee found that mostof the companies intend to treat their air toxics communicationsas an extension of the caer programhowever we should realize that the air toxics issue presentssome communications barriers that are quite different from ourcaer effortfor one thing chemical plants in a community usually producewidely differing product slates so while one plant can boast tothe local media about its relatively clean products and lack oftoxic air emissions a neighboring plant manager may have a devilof a time explaining why he cant comment about chronic airemissions of his highlytoxlc products remember too that mostof these same plants worked closely together in introducing the caer program to the community the unified local approach thatworked so well with the caer program also could suffer whendifferent plants are at different stages of implementing theirair toxics programsanother concern is that many plant managers understandably arereluctant to be as aggressive in promoting the air toxics issueas they were with caer the reason is clear admitting tochronic air emissions of toxic chemicals is not a pleasant dutyand in some cases managers are not in a position to comment aboutthe longterm effects of exposure to these emissionsin overcoming these concerns the communications committee cmastaff and your local managers will carry out a comprehensive andeffective communications program weve already held our firstair toxics communications workshop  earlier this month inhouston it was well attended including many plant managersand many important questions were raised we do plan to be a bitcautious in our approach to this communications program and ihope you agree with our thinkingcma w also plan to build on the caer communications success inhelping local plant people cope with the title iii provision ofsuperfund these provisions will require your plants to makemore information available about your products and processes thanever before it will all be available at once and it will beavailable to anyone who wants it already some environmentalgroups have shown what they can do to embarrass us with our owninformation taken out of context the committee has formed aseparate task group that will help us formulate ourcommunications policy in this areaour final major objective in  is to continue to assist thestate chemical councils in improving their communicationscapabilities weve already have made important progress inillinois louisiana and new jersey and well be working withmore states in the futurethis statelevel activity becomes more important when you realizethat propositiontype legislation will expand from californiato many other states the cics so far have been receptive to ourhelp and we plan to continue this partnershipso our  agenda will consist of four major objectivesfollowing up on caer communications extending our communicationsactivities to cover the air toxics and title iii issues andworking with the cics these objectives are in addition ofcourse to our ongoing work with other committees within cma toprovide communications counsel and handson help as requiredthe committee feels that these goals are achievable with currentmanpower and with current resourcesi would like to close with a comment that doesnt fall readilyinto our normal communications topicsthe committee feels that we should be wary of the recent attackson the socalled corpocracy of major us companies whileits too early to call this a major trend there are a lot ofpeople cut there including some in the current administrationwho may well be taking shots at us businessmenexecutives could be blamed for everything from working too hardon their golf game to operating bloated and inefficientorganizations to sacrificing the bluecollar workers future forthe sake of their friends in the executive suitealong these lines gm may be the first company to enter thisquagmire that companys soso performance the perot buyoutthe wave of midwest plant closings and a weak product slate havecombined to focus public and media attention on the personalcapabilities of those managing the giant auto companycma while gm may be the first we shouldnt be fooled into thinkingthe publics attention will stop there this is a trend wellall have to watch very closelyin conclusion  saw the chemical industrys reputation withthe public improve for the first time in several years thisuptick did not come about by accident it occurred because weoperated safely moved aggressively to meet the publicslegitimate concerns about our operations and took the time totell people what we were doingthrough caer and other programs we showed a lot of confidence inthe american public last year maybe theyre beginning to returnthat confidence i hope sowe look forward to earning your continued support throughout i will be pleased to try to answer any questions you mighthave about the communications
